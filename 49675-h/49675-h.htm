<h2>CHAPTER XLVI<br />

ALTERNATING CURRENTS</h2>


<p>The word "alternating" is used with a large number of
electrical and magnetic quantities to denote that their magnitudes
vary continuously, passing repeatedly through a definite
cycle of values in a definite interval of time.</p>

<p>As applied to the flow of electricity, an alternating current may
be defined as: <em>A current which reverses its direction in a periodic
manner, rising from zero to maximum strength, returning to zero,
and then going through similar variations in strength in the opposite
direction</em>; these changes comprise the cycle which is repeated
with great rapidity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The properties of alternating currents are more complex than those
of continuous currents, and their behavior more difficult to predict.
This arises from the fact that the magnetic effects are of far more
importance than those of steady currents. With the latter the magnetic
effect is constant, and has no reactive influence on the current
when the latter is once established. The lines of force, however, produced
by alternating currents are changing as rapidly as the current itself,
and they thus induce electric pressures in neighboring circuits, and
even in adjacent parts of the same circuit. This inductive influence in
alternating currents renders their action very different from that of
continuous current.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What are the advantages of alternating current
over direct current?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The reduced cost of transmission by use of high voltages
and transformers, greater simplicity of generators and motors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_998" id="Page_998">[Pg 998]</a></span>
facility of transforming from one voltage to another (either
higher or lower) for different purposes.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figs. 1,206 to 1,212.</span>&mdash;Apparatus which operates successfully on a direct current circuit. The direct current will operate incandescent
lamps, arc lamps, electric heating apparatus, electro-plating and typing bath, direct current motors; charge storage
batteries, produce electro-chemical action. It will flow through a straight wire or just as freely through the same wire when
wound over an iron bar.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p0998b.jpg" width="700" height="159" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figs. 1,213 to 1,217.</span>&mdash;Apparatus which operates successfully on an alternating circuit. The alternating current will operate incandescent
lamps, arc lamps, electric heating apparatus, alternating current motors. It will flow through a straight wire with
slightly increased retarding effect, but if the wire be wound on an iron bar its strength is greatly reduced.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_999" id="Page_999">[Pg 999]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The size of wire needed to transmit a given amount of electrical energy
(watts) with a given percentage of drop, being <em>inversely proportional
to the square of the voltage employed</em>, the great saving in copper by the use
of alternating current at high pressure must be apparent. This advantage
can be realized either by a saving in the weight of wire required, or by
transmitting the current to a greater distance with the same weight of
copper.</p>

<p>In alternating current electric lighting, the primary voltage is usually
at least 1,000 and often 2,000 to 10,000 volts.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. Why is alternating current used instead of
direct current on constant pressure lighting circuits?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It is due to the greater ease with which the current
can be transformed from higher to lower pressures.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. How is this accomplished?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. By means of simple transformers, consisting merely
of two or more coils of wire wound upon an iron core.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Since there are no moving parts, the attention required and the likelihood
of the apparatus getting out of order are small. The apparatus
necessary for direct current consists of a motor dynamo set which is
considerably more costly than a transformer and not so efficient.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What are some of the disadvantages of alternating
current?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The high pressure at which it is used renders it dangerous,
and requires more efficient insulation; alternating current
cannot be used for such purposes as electro-plating, charging
storage batteries, etc.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,218.</span>&mdash;Application and construction of the sine curve. The sine curve is a wavelike curve used to represent the changes
in strength and direction of an alternating current. At the left of the figure is shown an elementary alternator, consisting
of a loop of wire ABCD, whose ends are attached to the ring F, and shaft G, being arranged to revolve in a uniform magnetic
field, as indicated by the vertical arrows representing magnetic lines at equidistances. The alternating current induced in
the loop is carried to the external circuit through the brushes M and S. The loop, as shown, is in its horizontal position at
right angles to the magnetic field. The dotted circle indicates the circular path described by AB or CD during the revolution
of the loop. Now, as the loop rotates, the induced electric pressure will vary in such a manner that <em>its intensity at any
point of the rotation is proportional to the sine of the angle corresponding to that point</em>. Hence, on the horizontal line which passes
through the center of the dotted circle, take any length as 08, and divide into any number of equal parts representing fractions
of a revolution, as 0&deg;, 90&deg;, 180&deg;, etc. Erect perpendiculars at these points, and from the corresponding points on the dotted
circle project lines (parallel to 08) to the perpendiculars; these intersections give points, on the sine curve, for instance,
through 2 at the 90&deg; point of the revolution of the loop, and projecting over to the corresponding perpendicular gives 2'2,
whose length is proportional to the electric pressure at that point. In like manner other points are obtained, and the
curved line through them will represent the variation in the electric pressure for all points of the revolution. At 90&deg; the
pressure is at a maximum, hence by using a pressure scale such that the length of the perpendicular 2'2 for 90&deg; will measure
the maximum pressure, the length of the perpendicular at any other point will represent the actual pressure at that point.
The curve lies above the horizontal axis during the first half of the revolution and below it during the second half, which
indicates that the current flows in one direction for a half revolution, and in the opposite direction during the remainder of
the revolution.</p></div>

<p><strong>Alternating Current Principles.</strong>&mdash;In the operation of a
direct current generator or <em>dynamo</em>, as explained in Chapter
XIII, alternating currents are generated in the armature winding
and are changed into direct current by the action of the commutator.
It was therefore necessary in that chapter, in presenting
the basic principles of the dynamo, to explain the
generation of alternating currents at length, and the graphic
method of representing the alternating current cycle by the
sine curve. In order to avoid unnecessary repetition, the reader
should carefully review the above mentioned chapter before
continuing further. The diagram fig. 168, showing the construction
and application of the sine curve to the alternating
current, is however for convenience here shown enlarged (fig. 1,218).
In the diagram the various
alternating current terms
are graphically defined.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is an alternation?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The changes which the current undergoes in rising
from zero to maximum pressure and returning back to zero;
that is, a single positive or negative "wave" or half period, as
shown in fig. 1,221.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Define the term "period."</strong></p>

<p>Ans. This is the time of one cycle of the alternating current.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is periodicity?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. A term sometimes used for <em>frequency</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Frequency.</strong>&mdash;If a slowly varying alternating current be passed
through an incandescent lamp, the filament will be seen to vary
in brightness, following the change of current strength. If,
however, the alternations take place more rapidly than about
50 to 60 per second, the eye cannot follow the variations and the
lamp appears to burn steadily. Hence it is important to consider
the rate at which the alternations take place, or as it is called,
the <em>frequency</em>, which is defined as: <em>the number of cycles per second</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p1004a.jpg" width="700" height="280" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,223.</span>&mdash;Diagram of alternator and engine, illustrating <em>frequency</em>. The frequency or
<em>cycles per second</em> is equal to <em>the revolution of armature per second multiplied by one-half the
number of poles per phase</em>. In the figure the armature makes 6 revolutions to one of the
engine; one-half the number of poles&nbsp;=&nbsp;8&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, hence frequency&nbsp;=&nbsp;(150&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;6)&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;60
= 60. The expression in the parenthesis gives the cycles per minute, and dividing by 60,
the cycles per <em>second</em>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In a two pole machine, the frequency is the same as the number
of revolutions <em>per second</em>, but in multipolar machines, it is
greater in proportion to the number of <em>pairs</em> of poles per phase.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What frequencies are used in commercial
machines?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The two standard frequencies are 25 and 60 cycles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p1005a.jpg" width="700" height="283" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,224</span>&mdash;Diagram answering the question: Why are alternators always built multipolar?
They are made multipolar because it is desirable that the frequency be high. It is evident
from the figure that to obtain high frequency would require too many revolutions of the
armature of a bipolar machine for mechanical safety&mdash;especially in large alternators.
Moreover a double reduction gear in most cases would be necessary, adding complication
to the drive. Comparing the above illustration with fig. 1,223, shows plainly the reason
for multipolar construction.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. For what service are these frequencies adapted?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The 25 cycle frequency is used for conversion to direct
current, for alternating current railways, and for machines of
large size; the 60 cycle frequency is used for general distribution
for lighting and power.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The frequency of 40 cycles, which once was introduced as a compromise
between 25 and 60 has been found not desirable, as it is somewhat
low for general distribution, and higher than desirable for conversion
to direct current.</p></div>

</div>

<p><strong>Ques. What are
the advantages of
low frequency?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The number of
revolutions of the <em>rotor</em>
is correspondingly low;
arc lamps can be more
readily operated; better
pressure regulation;
small motors such as
fan motors can be operated
more easily from
the circuit.</p>

<p><strong>Phase.</strong>&mdash;As applied

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 1,226 and 1,227.&mdash;Diagram and sine curves illustrating <em>synchronism</em>. If two alternators,
with coils in parallel planes, be made to rotate at the same speed by connecting
them with chain drive or equivalent means, they will then be "in synchronism" that is,
the alternating pressure or current in one will vary in step with that in the other. In
other words, the cycles of one take place with the same frequency and at the same time
as the cycles of the other as indicated by the curves, fig. 1,226. It should be noted that
the maximum values are not necessarily the same but the maximum and zero values
must occur at the same time in both machines, and the maximum value must be of the
same sign. If the waves be distorted the maximum values may not occur simultaneously.

<p><strong>Synchronism.</strong>&mdash;This term may be defined as: <em>the simultaneous

<p><strong>Maximum Volts and Amperes.</strong>&mdash;In the operation of an
alternator, the pressure and strength of the current are continually
rising, falling and reversing. During each cycle there
are two points at which the pressure or current reaches its
greatest value, being known as the <em>maximum value</em>. This
maximum value is not used to any great extent, but it shows the
maximum to which the pressure rises, and hence, the greatest
strain to which the insulation of the alternator is subjected.</p>

per second, and the maximum number of lines of force embraced by the loop in the
position shown (the zero position) be denoted by N, then each limb will cut 2N lines per
second, because it cuts every line during the right sweep and again during the left
sweep. Hence each limb develops an average pressure of 2N units (C.G.S. units),
and as both limbs are connected in series, the total pressure is 4N units <em>per revolution</em>.
Now, if the loop make <em>f</em> revolutions <em>per second</em> instead of only one, then <em>f</em> times as many
lines will be cut <em>per second</em>, and the average pressure will be 4N <em>f</em> units. Since the C.G.S.

<p><strong>Ques. Of what use is the average value?</strong></p>

The corresponding English adjective is <em>efficacious</em>; but some engineers mistranslate it with the

its usual meaning in kinematics to represent the resolved part of a force which acts obliquely
to the line of motion, the effective force being the whole force multiplied by the cosine of the

to the square of the volts.</p>

<p>The readings which
these instruments give, if
first calibrated by using
steady currents, are not
true means, but are <em>the
square roots of the means of
the squares</em>.</p>

<p>Now the mean of the
squares of the sine (taken
over either one quadrant or
a whole circle) is &frac12;; hence
the <em>square root of mean
square</em> value of the sine
functions is obtained by
multiplying their maximum
value by 1&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;&#8730;<span class="bt">2</span>, or by
0.707.</p>

<p>The arithmetical mean
of the values of the sine,
however, is 0.637. Hence
an alternating current, if it
obey the sine law, will produce
a heating effect greater
than that of a steady current
of the same average
strength, by the ratio of
0.707 to 0.637; that is,
about 1.11 times greater.</p>

<p>If a Cardew voltmeter
be placed on an alternating
circuit in which the volts
are oscillating between
maxima of +100 and -100
volts, it will read 70.7 volts,
though the arithmetical
mean is really only 63.7;
and 70.7 steady volts would
be required to produce an
equal reading.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,237.</span>&mdash;Diagram illustrating <em>virtual</em> and <em>effective</em> pressure. If the coil be short circuited
by the switch and a constant virtual pressure be impressed on the circuit, the whole of
the impressed pressure will be effective in causing current to flow around the circuit.
In this case the virtual and effective pressures will be equal. If the coil be switched into
circuit, the reverse pressure due to self induction will oppose the virtual pressure; hence, the
effective pressure (which is the difference between the virtual and reverse pressures) will
be reduced, the virtual or impressed pressure remaining constant all the time. A virtual
current <em>is that indicated by an ammeter regardless of the phase relation between current and
pressure</em>. An effective current <em>is that indicated by an ammeter when the current is in phase
with the pressure</em>. In practice, the current is hardly ever in phase with the pressure, usually
lagging, though sometimes leading in phase. Now the greater this phase difference, either
way, the less is the power of a given virtual current to do work. With respect to this
feature, effective current may be defined as: <em>that proportion of a given virtual current which
can do useful work</em>. If there be no phase difference, then effective current is equal to
virtual current.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The matter may be looked at in a different way. If an alternating
current is to produce in a given wire the same amount of effect as a
continuous current of 100 amperes, since the alternating current goes
down to zero twice in each period, it is clear that it must at some point
in the period rise to a maximum greater than 100 amperes. How much
greater must the maximum be? The answer is that, if it undulate
up and down with a pure wave form, its maximum must be &#8730;<span class="bt">2</span> times
as great as the virtual mean; or conversely the virtual amperes will
be equal to the maximum divided by &#8730;<span class="bt">2</span>. In fact, to produce equal
effect, the equivalent direct current will be a kind of mean between the
maximum and the zero value of the alternating current; but it must
not be the arithmetical mean, nor the geometrical mean, nor the harmonic
mean, but the <em>quadratic</em> mean; that is, it will be the <em>square root
of the mean of the squares</em> of all the instantaneous values between zero
and maximum.</p></div>

<p><strong>Effective Volts and Amperes.</strong>&mdash;Virtual pressure, although
already explained, may be further defined as the pressure
<em>impressed</em> on a circuit. Now, in nearly all circuits the impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1014" id="Page_1014">[Pg 1014]</a></span>
or virtual pressure meets with an opposing pressure due to
inductance and hence the <em>effective</em> pressure is something less
than the virtual, being defined as <em>that pressure which is
available for driving electricity around the circuit, or for doing
work</em>. The difference between virtual and effective pressure is
illustrated in fig. 1,237.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Does a given alternating voltage affect the
insulation of the circuit differently than a direct pressure
of the same value?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It puts more strain on the insulation in the same
proportion as the maximum pressure exceeds the virtual pressure.</p>

the average is 2&nbsp;/&nbsp;&#960; times the maximum, so that the form factor is &#960;/2&#8730;<span class="bt">2</span> or 1.11. The induction
wave which generates an alternating pressure wave has a maximum value proportional to
the area, that is, to the average value of the pressure wave. Hence the induction values
corresponding to two pressure waves whose virtual values are equal, will be inversely
proportional to their form factors. This is illustrated by the fact that a <em>peaked</em> wave
causes less hysteresis loss in a transformer core than a flat topped wave, owing to the
higher form factor of the peaked wave. See wave forms, figs. 1,245 to 1,248.</p></div>

direct currents, as illustrated in figs. 1,239 and 1,240.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

the volts range from +100 to -100, it will read 70.7 volts, although
the arithmetical average, irrespective of + or-sign, is only 63.7 volts.
If the voltmeter be connected to a direct current circuit, the pressure
necessary to give the same reading would be 70.7 volts.</p></div>

is, the alternating current has about 11 per cent. more heating power than the direct current
of the same <em>average</em> pressure. The reader should be careful not to get a wrong conception
of the above; it does not mean that there is a saving by using alternating current.
When both voltmeters read the same, that is, when the <em>virtual</em> pressure of the alternating
current is the same as the direct current pressure, the heating effect is of course the same.</p></div>

<p>The ideal wave curve is the so called <em>true sine wave</em>, and is
obtained with a rate of cutting of lines of force, by the armature
coils, equivalent to the swing of a pendulum, which increases
in speed from the end to the middle of the swing, decreasing at
the same rate after passing the center. This swing is expressed

<p>The losses in all secondary apparatus are slightly lower with
the so called <em>peaked</em> form of wave. For the same virtual voltage,
however, the top of the peak will be much higher, thereby submitting
the insulation to that much greater strain. By reason
of the fact that the losses are less under such wave forms, many
manufacturers in submitting performance data on transformers
recite that the figures are for sine wave conditions, stating
further that if the transformers are to be operated in a circuit
more peaked than the sine wave, the losses will be less than
shown.</p>

<p>The slight saving in the losses of secondary apparatus, obtained
with a peaked wave, by no means compensates for the increased
insulation strains and an alternator having a true sine wave is
preferred.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What determines the form of the wave?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. 1. The number of coils per phase per pole, 2, shape of
pole faces, 3, eddy currents in the pole pieces, and 4, the air gap.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What are the requirements for proper rate of

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figs. 1,250 to 1,252.</span>&mdash;Hydraulic analogy illustrating the difference between <em>direct</em> (continuous)
and <em>alternating</em> current. In fig. 1,250 a centrifugal pump C forces water to the upper
pipe, from which it falls by gravity to the lower pipe B and re-enters the pump. The
current is continuous, always flowing in one direction, that is, it does not reverse its direction.
Similarly a direct electric current is constant in direction (does not reverse);
though not necessarily constant in value. A direct current, constant in both value and
direction as a result of constant pressure, is called "continuous" current. Similarly in
the figure the flow is constant, and a gauge D placed at any point will register a constant
pressure, hence the current may be called, in the electrical sense, "continuous." The
conditions in fig. 1,251 are quite different. The illustration represents a double acting
cylinder with the ends connected by a pipe A, and the piston driven by crank and Scotch
yoke as shown. In operation, if the cylinder and pipe be full of water, a current of water
will begin to flow through the pipe in the direction indicated as the piston begins its stroke,
increasing to maximum velocity at one-quarter revolution of the crank, decreasing and
coming to rest at one-half revolution, then reversing and reaching maximum velocity
in the reverse direction at three-quarter revolution, and coming to rest again at the end of
the return stroke. A pressure gauge at G will register a pressure which varies with the
current. Since the alternating electric current undergoes similar changes, the sine curve
will apply equally as well to the pump cycle as to the alternating current cycle.</p></div>

<p><strong>Three Phase Current.</strong>&mdash;A three phase current consists of
three alternating currents of equal frequency and amplitude,
but differing in phase from each other by one-third of a period.
Three phase current as represented by sine curves is shown in
fig. 1,260, and by hydraulic analogy in fig. 1,262. Inspection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1027" id="Page_1027">[Pg 1027]</a></span>
figures will show that when any one of the currents is at its
maximum, the other two are of half their maximum value,
and are flowing in the opposite direction.</p>

cylinders are here shown with pistons connected through Scotch yokes to cranks placed
120&deg; apart. The same action takes place in each cylinder as in the preceding cases, the
only difference being the additional cylinder, and difference in phase relation.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. How is three phase current generated?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It requires three equal windings on the alternator
armature, and they must be spaced out over its surface so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1028" id="Page_1028">[Pg 1028]</a></span>
to be successively &#8531; and &#8532; of the period (that is, of the double
pole pitch) apart from one another.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. How many wires are used for three phase
distribution?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Either six wires or three wires.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Six wires, as in fig. 1,260, might be used where it is desired to supply
entirely independent circuits, or as is more usual only three wires are
used as shown in fig. 1,261. In this case it should be observed that if the
voltage generated in each one of the three phases separately E (virtual)
volts, the voltage generated between any two of the terminals will be
equal to &#8730;<span class="bt">3</span>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;E. Thus, if each of the three phases generate 100
volts, the voltage from the terminal of the A phase to that of the B
phase will be 173 volts.</p></div>

incandescent lamp be connected in series with a coil made of one pound of No. 20 magnet
wire, and connected to the circuit, the current through the lamp will be decreased due to
the self-induction of the coil. If now an iron core be gradually pushed into the coil,
the self-induction will be greatly increased and the lamp will go out, thus showing the great
importance which self-induction plays in alternating current work.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Inductance.</strong>&mdash;Each time a direct current is started, stopped
or varied in strength, the magnetism changes, and induces or
tends to induce a pressure in the wire which always has a direction
opposing the pressure which originally produced the current.
<em>This self-induced pressure tends to weaken the main current at
the start and prolong it when the circuit is opened.</em></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The expression <em>inductance</em> is frequently used in the same sense as
<em>coefficient of self-induction</em>, which is a quantity pertaining to an electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1029" id="Page_1029">[Pg 1029]</a></span>
circuit depending on its geometrical form and the nature of the surrounding
medium.</p></div>

<p>If the direct current maintains the same strength and flow
steadily, <em>there will be no variations in the magnetic field surrounding
the wire and no self-induction</em>, consequently the only retarding
effect of the current will be the "<em>ohmic resistance</em>" of the wire.</p>

<p>If an alternating current be sent through a circuit, there will
be two retarding effects:</p>

<p>1. The <em>ohmic</em> resistance;</p>

<p>2. The <em>spurious</em> resistance.</p>

the effect of the self-induction. A curve of this kind is shown in fig. 1,302.</p></div>

<p>The henry<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is too large a unit for use in practical computations,
which involves that the millihenry, or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1,000</sub>th
henry, is the accepted unit. In pole suspended lines the
inductance varies as the metallic resistance, the distance between
the wires on the cross arm and the number of cycles per second,
as indicated by accepted tables. Thus, for one mile of No.

noted for his researches in electromagnetism. He developed the electromagnet, which had
been invented by Sturgeon in England, so that it became an instrument of far greater power
than before. In 1831, he employed a mile of fine copper wire with an electromagnet, causing
the current to attract the armature and strike a bell, thereby establishing the principle employed
in modern telegraph practice. He was made a professor at Princeton in 1832, and while
experimenting at that time, he devised an arrangement of batteries and electromagnets embodying
the principle of the telegraph relay which made possible long distance transmission. He was
the first to observe magnetic self-induction, and performed important investigations in oscillating
electric discharges (1842), and other electrical phenomena. In 1846 he was chosen secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, an office which he held until his death. As chairman
of the U. S. Lighthouse Board, he made important tests in marine signals and lights. In
meteorology, terrestrial magnetism, and acoustics, he carried on important researches. Henry

The two cylinders are connected at their ends by the vertical pipes, each being
provided with a piston and the system filled with water. Reciprocating motion is imparted
to the lower pulley by Scotch yoke connection with the drive pulley. The upper
piston is connected by rack and pinion gear with a fly wheel. In operation, the to and fro
movement of the lower piston produces an alternating flow of water in the upper cylinder
which causes the upper piston to move back and forth. The rack and pinion connection
with the fly wheel causes the latter to revolve first in one direction, then in the other, in
step with the upper piston. The inertia of the fly wheel causes it to resist any change
in its state, whether it be at rest or in motion, which is transmitted to the upper piston,
causing it to offer resistance to any change in its rate or direction of motion. Inductance
in the alternating current circuit has precisely the same effect, that is, <em>it opposes any
change in the strength or direction of the current</em>.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. How does the inductance of a coil vary with
respect to the core?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It is least with an air core; with an iron core, it is
greater in proportion to the permeability<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the iron.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> NOTE.&mdash;The permeability of iron varies from 500 to 1,000 or more. The permeability of
a given sample of iron is not constant, but decreases in value as the magnetizing force increases.
Therefore the inductance of a coil having an iron core is not a constant quantity as is the
inductance of an air core coil.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The coefficient L for a given coil is a constant quantity so long as the
magnetic permeability of the material surrounding the coil does not
change. This is the case where the coil is surrounded by air. When
iron is present, the coefficient L is practically constant, provided the magnetism
is not forced too high.</p>

<p>In most cases arising in practice, the coefficient L may be considered
to be a constant quantity, just as the resistance R is usually considered
constant. The coefficient L of a coil or circuit is often spoken of as its
<em>inductance</em>.</p></div>

the switch so as to put the lamp and inductive coil in parallel and the lamp will burn

by the inductive coil to the current, less current is shunted from the lamp when
the inductive coil is in the circuit than when the non-inductive coil is in the circuit. That
is, each coil has the same ohmic resistance, but the inductive coil has in addition the
spurious resistance due to inductance, hence it shunts less current from the lamp than
does the non-inductive coil.</p></div>

fig. 1,274, 4,600 volt coil; fig. 1,275, 6,600 volt coil. A choke coil is <em>a coil with large
inductance and small resistance, used to impede alternating currents</em>. The choke coil is
used extensively as an auxiliary to the lightning arrester. In this connection the
primary objects of the choke coil should be: 1, to hold back the lightning disturbance
from the transformer or generator until the lightning arrester discharges to earth.
If there be no lightning arrester the choke coil evidently cannot perform this function.
2, to lower the frequency of the oscillation so that whatever charge gets through the
choke coil will be of a frequency too low to cause a serious drop of pressure around the
first turns of the end coil in either generator or transformer. Another way of expressing
this is from the standpoint of wave front: a steep wave front piles up the pressure when
it meets an inductance. The second function of the choke coil is, then, to smooth out
the wave front of the surge. The principal electrical condition to be avoided is that of
resonance. The coil should be so arranged that if continual surges be set up in the
circuit, a resonant voltage due to the presence of the choke coil cannot build up at the
transformer or generator terminals. In the types shown above, the hour glass coil has
the following advantages on high voltages: 1, should there be any arcing between
adjacent turns the coils will re-insulate themselves, 2, they are mechanically strong, and
sagging is prevented by tapering the coils toward the center turns, 3, the insulating
supports can be best designed for the strains which they have to withstand. Choke
coils should not be used in connection with cable systems.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,278.</span>&mdash;- Diagram illustrating effect of capacity in an alternating circuit. Considering its
action during one cycle of the current, the alternator first "pumps," say from M to S;
electricity will be heaped up, so to speak, on S, and a deficit left on M, that is, S will be
+ and M-. If the alternator be now suddenly stopped, there would be a momentary
return flow of electricity from S to M through the alternator. If the alternator go on
working, however, it is obvious that the electricity heaped up on S helps or increases the
flow when the alternator begins to pump from S to M in the second half of the cycle, and
when the alternator again reverses its pressure, the + charge on M flows round to S, and
helps the ordinary current. The above circuit is not strictly analogous to the insulated
plates of a condenser, but, as is verified in practice, that with a rapidly alternating pressure,
the condenser action is not perceptibly affected if the cables be connected across by
some non-inductive resistance as for instance incandescent lamps.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Capacity.</strong>&mdash;When an electric pressure is applied to a condenser,
the current plays in and out, charging the condenser in
alternate directions. As the current runs in at one side and out
at the other, the dielectric becomes charged, and tries to discharge
itself by setting up an opposing electric pressure. This
opposing pressure rises just as the charge increases.</p>

<p>A mechanical analogue is afforded by the bending of a spring,
as in fig. 1,279, which, as it is being bent, exerts an opposing force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1040" id="Page_1040">[Pg 1040]</a></span>
equal to that applied, provided the latter do not exceed the
capacity of the spring.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the effect of capacity in an alternating
circuit?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It is exactly opposite to that of inductance, that is,
it assists the current to rise to its maximum value sooner than
it would otherwise.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,279.</span>&mdash;Mechanical analogy illustrating effect of capacity in an alternating circuit. If an
alternating twisting force be applied to the top R of the spring S, the action of the latter
may be taken to represent capacity, and the rotation of the wheel W, alternating current.
The twisting force (impressed pressure) must first be applied <em>before</em> the rotation of W
(current) will begin. The resiliency or rebounding effect of the spring will, in time, cause
the wheel W to move (amperes) in advance of the twisting force (voltage) thus representing
the current <em>leading in phase</em>.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. Is it necessary to have a continuous metallic
circuit for an alternating current?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. No, it is possible for an alternating current to flow
through a circuit which is divided at some point by insulating
material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1041" id="Page_1041">[Pg 1041]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. How can the current flow under such condition?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Its flow depends on the capacity of the circuit and
accordingly a condenser may be inserted in the circuit as in
fig. 1,286, thus interposing an insulated gap, yet permitting an
alternating flow in the metallic portion of the circuit.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,280.</span>&mdash;Hydraulic analogy illustrating capacity in an alternating current circuit. A
chamber containing a rubber diaphragm is connected to a double acting cylinder and the
system filled with water. In operation, as the piston moves, say to the left from the
center, the diaphragm is displaced from its neutral position N, and stretched to some
position M, in so doing offering increasing resistance to the flow of water. On the
return stroke the flow is reversed and is assisted by the diaphragm during the first half
of the stroke, and opposed during the second half. The diaphragm thus acts with the
flow of water one-half of the time and in opposition to it one-half of the time. This
corresponds to the electrical pressure at the terminals of a condenser connected in an
alternating current circuit, and it has a maximum value when the current is zero and a
zero value when the current is a maximum.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. Name the unit of capacity and define it.</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The unit of capacity is called the <em>farad</em> and its symbol is
C. A condenser is said to have a capacity of one farad if one
coulomb (that is, one ampere flowing one second), when stored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1042" id="Page_1042">[Pg 1042]</a></span>
on the plates of the condenser will cause a pressure of one volt
across its terminals.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The farad being a very large unit, the capacities ordinarily encountered
in practice are expressed in millionths of a farad, that is, in <em>microfarads-</em>-a
capacity equal to about three miles of an Atlantic cable.</p></div>

<p>It should be noted that the microfarad is used only for convenience,
and that <em>in working out problems, capacity should
always be expressed in farads before substituting in formul&aelig;</em>,
because the farad is chosen with respect to the volt and ampere,
as above defined, and hence must be used in formul&aelig; along with
these units.</p>

farad if it will absorb one coulomb of electricity when subjected to a pressure of one volt.
The farad is a very large unit, and accordingly the microfarad or one millionth of a farad
is often used, though <em>this must be reduced to farads before substituting in formul&aelig;</em>.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the material between the plates of a
condenser called?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The <em>dielectric</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Upon what does the capacity of a condenser
depend?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It is proportional to the area of the plates, and inversely
proportional to the thickness of the dielectric between the
plates, a correction being required unless the thickness of dielectric
be very small as compared with the dimensions of the plates.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The capacity of a condenser is also proportional to the <em>specific inductive
capacity</em> of the dielectric between the plates of the condenser.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,282.</span>&mdash;Condenser of one microfarad capacity. It is subdivided into five sections
of .5, .2, .2, .05 and .05 microfarad. The plates are mounted between and carried by lateral
brass bars which are fastened to a hard rubber top. Each pair of condenser terminals
is fastened to small binding posts mounted on hard rubber insulated posts.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Specific Inductive Capacity.</strong>&mdash;Faraday discovered that
different substances have different powers of carrying lines of
electric force. Thus the charge of two conductors having a
given difference of pressure between them depends on the medium
between them as well as on their size and shape. The number
indicating the magnitude of this property of the medium is
called its <em>specific inductive capacity</em>, or <em>dielectric constant</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1044" id="Page_1044">[Pg 1044]</a></span></p>

<p>The specific inductive capacity of air, which is nearly the same
as that of a vacuum, is taken as unity. In terms of this unit the
following are some typical values of the dielectric constant:
water 80, glass 6 to 10, mica 6.7, gutta-percha 3, India rubber
2.5, paraffin wax 2, ebonite 2.5, castor oil 4.8.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In underground cables for very high pressures, the insulation, if
homogeneous throughout, would have to be of very great thickness in
order to have sufficient dielectric strength. By employing material of
high specific inductive capacity close to the conductor, and material
of lower specific inductive capacity toward the outside, that is, by
<em>grading</em> the insulation, a considerably less total thickness affords equally
high dielectric strength.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ohmic Value of Capacity.</strong>&mdash;The capacity of an alternating
current circuit is the measure of the amount of electricity held
by it when its terminals are at unit difference of pressure. Every
such circuit acts as a condenser.</p>

<p>If an alternating circuit, having no capacity, be opened, no
current can be produced in it, but if there be capacity at the
break, current may be produced as in fig. 1,286.</p>

<p>The action of capacity referred to the current wave is as
follows: As the wave starts from zero value and rises to its
maximum value, the current is due to the discharge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1046" id="Page_1046">[Pg 1046]</a></span>
capacity, which would be represented by a condenser. In the
case of a sine current, the period required for the current to pass
from zero value to maximum is one-quarter of a cycle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p1046a.jpg" width="700" height="521" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 1,285 and 1,286.&mdash;Diagrams showing effect of condenser in direct and alternating current
circuits. Each circuit contains an incandescent lamp and a condenser, one circuit connected
to a dynamo and the other to an alternator. Since the condenser interposes a gap
in the circuit, evidently in fig. 1,285 no current will flow. In the case of alternating current,
fig. 1,286, the condenser gap does not hinder the flow of current in the metallic
portion of the circuit. In fact the alternator produces a continual surging of electricity
backwards and forwards from the plates of the condenser around the metallic portion of
the circuit, similar to the surging of waves against a bulkhead which projects into the ocean.
It should be understood that the electric current ceases at the condenser, there being no
flow between the plates.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the beginning of the cycle, the condenser is charged to the
maximum amount it receives in the operation of the circuit.</p>

<p>At the end of the quarter cycle when the current is of maximum
value, the condenser is completely discharged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1047" id="Page_1047">[Pg 1047]</a></span></p>

<p>The condenser now begins to receive a charge, and continues
to receive it during the next quarter of a cycle, the charge attaining
its maximum value when the current is of zero intensity.
Hence, the <em>maximum charge of a condenser</em> in an alternating
circuit is equal to the average value of the current multiplied

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,288.</span>&mdash;Pressure and current curves, illustrating <em>lag</em>. The effect of inductance in a circuit
is to retard the current cycle, that is to say, if the current and pressure be in phase, the
introduction of inductance will cause a phase difference, the current wave "lagging"
behind the pressure wave as shown. In other words, inductance causes the current wave,
indicated in the diagram by the solid curve, to lag behind the pressure wave, indicated by
the dotted curve. Following the curves starting from the left end of the horizontal line, it
will be noted that the current starts after the pressure starts and reverses after the pressure
reverses; that is, <em>the current lags in phase behind the pressure</em>, although the frequency of
both is the same.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Lag and Lead.</strong>&mdash;Alternating currents do not always keep in
step with the alternating volts impressed upon the circuit. If
there be inductance in the circuit, the current will <em>lag</em>; if there
be capacity, the current will <em>lead</em> in phase. For example, fig.
1,288, illustrates the lag due to inductance and fig. 1,289, the
lead due to capacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1050" id="Page_1050">[Pg 1050]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is lag?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Lag denotes the condition where the phase of one
alternating current quantity lags behind that of another. The
term is generally used in connection with the effect of inductance
in causing the current to lag behind the impressed pressure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p1050a.jpg" width="700" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,289.</span>&mdash;Pressure and current curves illustrating <em>lead</em>. The effect of capacity in a circuit
is to cause the current to rise to its maximum value sooner than it would otherwise do;
capacity produces an effect exactly the opposite of inductance. The phase relation
between current and pressure with current leading is shown graphically by the two armature
positions in full and dotted lines, corresponding respectively to current and pressure
at the beginning of the cycle.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. How does inductance cause the current to lag
behind the pressure?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It tends to prevent changes in the strength of the
current. When two parts of a circuit are near each other, so
that one is in the magnetic field of the other, any change in the
strength of the current causes a corresponding change in the
magnetic field and sets up a reverse pressure in the other wire.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This induced pressure causes the current to reach its maximum value
a little later than the pressure, and also tends to prevent the current
diminishing in step with the pressure.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1051" id="Page_1051">[Pg 1051]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. What governs the amount of lag in an alternating
current?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It depends on the relative values of the various pressures
in the circuit, that is, upon the amount of resistance and
inductance which tends to cause lag, and the amount of capacity
in the circuit which tends to reduce lag and cause lead.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. How is lag measured?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. In degrees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p1051a.jpg" width="700" height="367" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,290.</span>&mdash;Mechanical analogy of lag. If at one end force be applied to turn a very long
shaft, having a loaded pulley at the other, the torsion thus produced in the shaft will
cause it to twist an appreciable amount which will cause the movement of the pulley to
<em>lag</em> behind that of the crank. This may be indicated by a rod attached to the pulley
and terminating in a pointer at the crank end, the rod being so placed that the pointer
registers with the crank when there is no torsion in the shaft. The angle made by the
pointer and crank when the load is thrown on, indicates the amount of lag which is
measured in degrees.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thus, in fig. 1,288, the lag is indicated by the distance between the
beginning of the pressure curve and the beginning of the current curve,
and is in this case 45&deg;.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the physical meaning of this?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. In an actual alternator, of which fig. 1,288 is an elementary
diagram showing one coil, if the current lag, say 45&deg;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1052" id="Page_1052">[Pg 1052]</a></span>
behind the pressure, it means that the coil rotates 45&deg; from its
position of zero induction before the current starts, as in fig. 1,288.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,293.</span>&mdash;Steam engine analogy of current flow at zero pressure (see questions below).
When the engine has reached the dead center point the full steam pressure is acting on
the piston, the valve having opened an amount equal to its lead. The force applied at this
instant, indicated by the arrow is perpendicular to the crank pin circle, that is, the tangential
or <em>turning</em> component is equal to zero, hence there is no pressure tending to turn the
crank. The latter continues in motion past the dead center because of the momentum
previously acquired. Similarly, the electric current, which is here analogous to the moving
crank, continues in motion, though the pressure at some instants be zero, because it acts
as though it had weight, that is, it cannot be stopped or started instantly.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. When an alternating current lags behind the
pressure, is there not a considerable current at times
when the pressure is zero?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Yes; such effect is illustrated by analogy in fig. 1,293.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the significance of this?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It does not mean that current could be obtained from
a circuit that showed no pressure when tested with a suitable
voltmeter, for no current would flow under such conditions.
However, in the flow of an alternating current, the pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1054" id="Page_1054">[Pg 1054]</a></span>
varies from zero to maximum values many times each second,
and the instants of no pressure may be compared to the "dead
centers" of an engine at which points there is no pressure to
cause rotation of the crank, the crank being carried past these
points by the momentum of the fly wheel. Similarly the electric
current does not stop at the instant of no pressure because
of the "momentum" acquired at other parts of the cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. On long lines having considerable inductance,
how may the lag be reduced?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. By introducing capacity into the circuit. In fact, the
current may be advanced so it will be in phase with the pressure
or even lead the latter, depending on the amount of capacity
introduced.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There has been some objection to the term <em>lead</em> as used in describing
the effect of capacity in an alternating circuit, principally on the ground
that such expressions as "lead of current," "lead in phase," etc., tend
to convey the idea that the effect precedes the cause, that is, the current
is in advance of the pressure producing it. There can, of course, be no
current until pressure has been applied, but if the circuit has capacity,
it will lead the pressure, and this peculiar behavior is best illustrated
by a mechanical analogy as has already been given.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What effect has lag or lead on the value of the
effective current?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. As the angle of lag or lead increases, the value of the
effective as compared with the virtual current diminishes.</p>

<p><strong>Reactance.</strong>&mdash;The term "reactance" means simply <em>reaction</em>.
It is used to express certain effects of the alternating current
other than that due to the ohmic resistance of the circuit.
Thus, <em>inductance reactance</em> means the reaction due to the spurious
resistance of inductance expressed in ohms; similarly, <em>capacity
reactance</em>, means the reaction due to capacity, expressed in ohms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1055" id="Page_1055">[Pg 1055]</a></span>
It should be noted that the term <em>reactance</em>, alone, that is, unqualified,
is generally understood to mean <em>inductance reactance</em>,
though ill advisedly so.</p>

<p>The resistance offered by a wire to the flow of a direct current
is expressed in ohms; this resistance remains constant whether
the wire be straight or coiled. If an alternating current flow
through the wire, there is in addition to the ordinary or "<em>ohmic</em>"
resistance of the wire, a "<em>spurious</em>" resistance arising from the
development of a reverse pressure due to induction, which is
more or less in value according as the wire be coiled or straight.
<em>This spurious resistance as distinguished from the ohmic resistance
is called the reactance, and is expressed in ohms.</em></p>

<p>Reactance, may then be defined with respect to its usual
significance, that is, <em>inductance reactance</em>, as <em>the component of the
impedance which when multiplied into the current, gives the
wattless component of the pressure.</em></p>

<p>Reactance is simply inductance measured in ohms.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,294.</span>&mdash;Diagram of the circuit for example I. Here the resistance is taken at zero,
but this would not be possible in practice, as all circuits contain more or less resistance
though it may be, in some cases, negligibly small.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>EXAMPLE I.&mdash;An alternating current having a frequency of 60 is
passed through a coil whose inductance is .5 henry. What is the reactance?</p>

<p>Here <em>f</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;60 and L&nbsp;=&nbsp;.5; substituting these in formula for inductive
reactance,</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1056" id="Page_1056">[Pg 1056]</a></span>

<p>The quantity 2&#960;<em>f</em>L or reactance being of the same nature as a resistance
is used in the same way as a resistance. Accordingly, since,
by Ohm's law</p>

<p class="center">E&nbsp;=&nbsp;RI       <span class="linenum">(1)</span>

</p>
</div>

<p>The foregoing example may serve to illustrate the difference in
behaviour of direct and alternating currents. As calculated, it
requires 565 volts to pass only 3 amperes of alternating current
through the coil on account of the considerable spurious resistance.
The ohmic resistance of a coil is very small, as compared
with the spurious resistance, say 2 ohms. Then by Ohm's law
I&nbsp;=&nbsp;E&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;R&nbsp;=&nbsp;565&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;282.5 amperes.</p>

<p>Instances of this effect are commonly met with in connection with

<p>When a circuit contains besides resistance, <em>both inductance

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,301.</span>&mdash;Simple choking coil. There is an important difference in the obstruction offered
to an alternating current by ordinary resistance and by reactance. Resistance obstructs
the current by dissipating its energy, which is converted into heat. Reactance obstructs
the current by setting up a reverse pressure, and so reduces the current in the circuit,
<em>without wasting much energy</em>, except by hysteresis in any iron magnetized. This may be
regarded as one of the advantages of alternating over direct current, for, by introducing
reactance into a circuit, the current may be cut down with comparatively little loss of
energy. This is generally done by increasing the inductance in a circuit, by means of
a device called variously a <em>reactance coil, impedance coil, choking coil</em>, or "<em>choker</em>." In the
figure is a coil of thick wire provided with a laminated iron core, which may be either
fixed or movable. In the first case, the inductance, and therefore also the reactance of the
coil, is invariable, with a given frequency. In the second case, the inductance and consequent
reactance may be respectively increased or diminished by inserting the core
farther within the coil or by withdrawing it, as was done in fig. 1,266, the results of
which are shown in fig. 1,302.</p></div>

it tends to reduce the spurious resistance due to inductance.</p>

<p>It is very seldom that a circuit is thus balanced unless intentionally

<p><strong>Ques. Define "critical frequency."</strong></p>

<p>Ans. In bringing a circuit to a state of resonance by increasing
the frequency, the current will increase with increasing
frequency until the critical frequency is reached, and then the
current will decrease in value for further increase of frequency.
The critical frequency occurs when the circuit reaches the

current to distribute itself unequally through the cross section of the conductor as shown
by the varied shading flowing most strongly in the outer portions of the conductor. For
this reason it has been proposed to use hollow or flat conductors instead of solid round
wires. However with frequency not exceeding 100 the skin effect is negligibly small in
copper conductors of the sizes usually employed. Where the conductor is large or the
frequency high the effect may be judged by the following examples calculated by Professor
J. J. Thomson: In the case of a copper conductor exposed to an electromotive force
making 100 periods per second at 1 centimetre from the surface, the maximum current
would be only .208 times that at the surface; at a depth of 2 centimetres it would be
only .043; and at a depth of 4 centimetres less than .002 part of the value at the
surface. If the frequency be a million per second the current at a depth of 1 millimetre
is less than one six-millionth part of its surface value. The case of an iron conductor is
even more remarkable. Taking the permeability at 100 and the frequency at 100 per
second the current at a depth of 1 millimetre is only .13 times the surface value; while
at a depth of 5 millimetres it is less than one twenty-thousandth part of its surface value.
The disturbance of current density may be looked upon as a self-induced eddy current in
the conductor. It necessarily results in an increase of ohmic loss; as compared with a
steady current: proportional to the square of the total current flowing and consequently
gives rise to an apparent increase of ohmic resistance. The coefficient of increase of resistance
depends upon the dimensions and the shape of the cross section, the frequency and
the specific resistance. A similar but distinct effect is experienced in conductors due to
the neighborhood of similar parallel currents. For example in a heavy multicore cable
the non-uniformity of current density in any core may be considered as partly due to eddy
currents induced by the currents in the neighboring cores and partly to the self-induced
eddy current. It is only the latter effect which should rightly be considered as comprised
under the term <em>skin effect</em>.</p></div>

<p>Ans. It is due to eddy currents induced in the conductor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Consider the wire as being composed of several small insulated wires
placed closely together. Now when a current is started along these
separate wires, mutual induction will take place between them, giving
rise to momentary reverse pressures. Those wires which are nearer the
center, since they are completely surrounded by neighboring wires, will
clearly have stronger reverse pressures set up in them than those on or
near the outer surface, so that the current will meet less opposition
near the surface than at the center, and consequently the flow will be
greater in the outer portions.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the result of skin effect?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It results in an apparent increase of resistance.</p>

<p>Hughes, about 1883, called attention to the fact that the resistance
of an iron telegraph wire was greater for rapid periodic currents than for
steady currents.</p>

<p>In 1888 Kelvin showed that when alternating currents at moderately
high frequency flow through massive conductors, the current is practically
confined to the skin, the interior portions being largely useless
for the purpose of conduction. The mathematical theory of the subject
has been developed by Kelvin, Heaviside, Rayleigh, and others.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII<br />

ALTERNATING CURRENT DIAGRAMS</h2>


<p>Whenever an alternating pressure is impressed on a circuit,
part of it is spent in overcoming the resistance, and the rest goes
to balance the reverse pressure due to self-induction.</p>

<p>The total pressure applied to the circuit is known as the
<em>impressed pressure</em>, as distinguished from that portion of it
called the <em>active pressure</em> which is used to overcome the resistance,
and that portion called the <em>self-induction pressure</em> used to
balance the reverse pressure of self-induction.</p>

<p>The intensity of the reverse pressure induced in a circuit due
to self-induction is proportional to the <em>rate of change in the
current strength</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thus a current, changing at the rate of one ampere per second, in
flowing through a coil having a coefficient of self-induction of one henry,
will induce a reverse pressure of one volt.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. Describe how the rate of change in current
strength varies, and how this affects the reverse pressure.</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The alternating current varies from zero to maximum
strength in one-quarter period, that is, in one-quarter revolution
of the generating loop or 90&deg; as represented by the sine curve
in fig. 1,307. Now, during, say, the first 10 degrees of rotation
(from 0 to A), the current jumps from zero value to A', or 4<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1068" id="Page_1068">[Pg 1068]</a></span>
amperes, according to
the scale; during some
intermediate 10 degrees
of the quarter
revolution, as from B
to C, the current increases
from B' to C' or
2&frac12; amperes, and during
another 10 degrees
as from D to E,
at the end of one-quarter
revolution
where the sine curve
reaches its amplitude,
it rises and falls &frac12;
ampere. It is thus
seen that the <em>rate of
change</em> varies from a
maximum when the
current is least, to
zero when the current
is at its maximum.
Accordingly, the reverse
pressure of self-induction
<em>being proportional
to the rate
of change in the current
strength</em>, is greatest
when the current is
at zero value, and
zero when the current
is at its maximum.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,307.</span>&mdash;Sine curve showing that the <em>rate of change</em> in the strength of an alternating current <em>is greatest when the current is least,
and zero when the current is at a maximum</em>. This is evident from the diagram, since during say the first 10&deg; as OA, the
current increases 4 amperes; during BC, 2&frac12; amperes; during DE it rises and falls &frac12; ampere. The reverse pressure of
self-induction being proportional to the <em>rate of change</em> of the current, is a maximum when the current is zero, and zero
when the current is a maximum, <em>giving a phase difference of 90&deg; between reverse pressure of self-induction and current</em>.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1069" id="Page_1069">[Pg 1069]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This relation is shown by curves in fig. 1,308, and it should be noted
that <em>the reverse pressure and current are 90&deg; apart</em> in phase. For this
reason many alternating current problems may be solved graphically
by the use of right angle triangles, the sides, drawn to some arbitrary
scale, to represent the quantities involved, such as resistance, reactance,
impedance, etc.</p></div>

<p><strong>Properties of Right Angle Triangles.</strong>&mdash;In order to understand
the graphical method of solving alternating current problems,
it is necessary to know why certain relations exist between
the sides of a right angle triangle. For instance, in every right
angle triangle:</p>

<p><em>The square of the hypothenuse is equal to the sum of the squares
on the other two sides.</em></p>

<p>That is, condensing this statement into the form of an equation:</p>

<p class="center"><em>hypothenuse<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;base<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;altitude<sup>2</sup></em>        <span class="linenum">(1)</span>
</p>

<p>the horizontal side being called the base and the vertical side,
the altitude.</p>

<p>This may be called the equation of the right angle triangle.</p>

and in phase is 90&deg; behind the current.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. Why is the square of the hypothenuse of a

<p>Ans. This may be explained with the aid of fig. 1,309. Draw

both resistance and inductance, it may be looked upon as split
up into two components, as already explained, one of which is
necessary to overcome the resistance, and the other, the inductance.
That is, the impressed pressure is split up into</p>


<ul><li>1. <em>Active pressure</em>, to overcome resistance;</li>
<li>2. <em>Self-induction pressure</em> to overcome inductance.</li>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,313.</span>&mdash;Diagram illustrating the <em>active</em>, and <em>self-induction</em> pressures, or the two components
of the impressed pressure in circuits containing resistance and inductance. The active
pressure is the volts required to overcome the resistance of the circuit. In the figure only
the portion from A to C is considered as having resistance (the rest being negligibly small)
except at R, a resistance equivalent to that of the inductive coil is inserted next to the
non-inductive coil, so P<sub><em>a</em></sub> will give the total "ohmic drop" or active pressure, that is,
the pressure necessary to force any equivalent direct current from A to C. This active
pressure P<sub><em>a</em></sub> or component of the impressed pressure is in phase with the current. The
other component or self-induction pressure P<sub><em>i</em></sub> that is the reactance drop necessary to
overcome the reverse pressure of self-induction and is at right angles to the current and 90&deg;
ahead of the current in phase. It is registered by a voltmeter between B and C, less the
pressure due to ohmic resistance of the inductive coil. The impressed pressure P<sub><em>im</em></sub> then
or total pressure required to force electricity around the circuit <em>not including the resistance</em>
R, (which is removed from the circuit when the reading of the impressed pressure is taken),
is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the two components, that is, P<sub><em>im</em></sub> =
&#8730;<span class="bt">(P<sub><em>a</em>}<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;P_{<em>i</em></sub><sup>2</sup>)</span>.</p></div>

<p>The active pressure is <em>in phase with the current</em>.</p>

<p>The self induction pressure is <em>at right angles to the current and 90
degrees ahead of the current in phase</em>.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. Why is the active pressure in phase with the
current?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The pressure used in overcoming resistance is from
Ohm's law, E&nbsp;=&nbsp;RI. Hence, when the current is zero, E is zero,
and when the current is a maximum E is a maximum. Hence,
that component of the impressed pressure necessary to overcome
the resistance must be <em>in phase with the current</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1076" id="Page_1076">[Pg 1076]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. Why is this?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Since the <em>reverse pressure of self induction</em> is 90&deg; behind
the current, the component of the impressed pressure necessary
to overcome the reverse pressure of self induction, being opposite
to this, will be represented as being 90&deg; ahead of the current.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The distinction between the reverse pressure of self-induction, that
is, the induced pressure, and the pressure necessary to overcome self-induction
should be carefully noted. They are two equal and opposite
forces, that is, two balancing forces just as is shown in fig. 1,310. Here,
in analogy, the thrust of the piston may represent the induced pressure
and the equal and opposite force indicated by the arrow <em>f</em>, the component
of the impressed pressure necessary to balance the induced
pressure.</p></div>

<p><strong>Circuits containing Resistance and Capacity.</strong>&mdash;The
effect of capacity in an alternating current circuit is to cause the
current to lead the pressure, since the reaction of a condenser,
instead of tending to prolong the current, tends to drive it back.</p>

<p>Careful distinction should be made between capacity <em>in
series</em> with a circuit and capacity <em>in parallel</em> with a branch of a
circuit. The discussion here refers to capacity in series, which
means that the circuit is not continuous but the ends are joined
to a condenser, as shown at the right in fig. 1,326, so that no current
can flow except into and out of the condenser.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,326,</span>&mdash;Circuit diagram illustrating the distinction between <em>capacity in series</em> and <em>capacity
in parallel</em>. The condition for <em>capacity in series</em> is that the circuit must be discontinuous
as at M; for <em>capacity in parallel</em> the main circuit must be continuous; this means that
the capacity must be inserted in a branch of the main circuit as at A. In the figure the
capacity S is connected <em>in series</em> with respect to the branch, that is, the branch is discontinuous,
but it is <em>in parallel</em> with respect to the main circuit, when the latter is continuous,
that is, when the switch W is closed. If W be opened, the main circuit becomes
discontinuous and S is changed from <em>in parallel</em> to <em>in series</em> connection.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. In circuits containing resistance and capacity
upon what does the amount of lead depend?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Upon the relative values of the resistance and the
capacity reactance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1085" id="Page_1085">[Pg 1085]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. Describe the action of a condenser when current
is applied.</strong></p>

<p>Ans. When the current begins to flow into a condenser, that
is, when the flow is maximum, the back pressure set up by the
condenser (called the <em>condenser pressure</em>) is zero, and when the
flow finally becomes zero, the condenser pressure is a maximum.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p1085a.jpg" width="700" height="336" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,327.</span>&mdash;Current and pressure curves showing that the condenser pressure is 90&deg; ahead
of the current. A current flowing into a condenser encounters a gradually increasing
pressure which opposes it, beginning from zero pressure when the current enters at maximum
flow and increasing to the same value as the current pressure, at which time the
current ceases to flow. Hence, since the current varies from zero to maximum in one
quarter period, or 90&deg;, the phase difference between current and condenser pressure is 90&deg;.
The condenser pressure reaching a positive maximum when the current starts from zero
on the positive wave, is 90&deg; ahead of the current.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. What does this indicate?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It shows that the phase difference between the wave
representing the condenser pressure and the current is 90&deg;, as
illustrated in fig. 1,327.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Is the condenser pressure ahead or behind the
current and why?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It is ahead of the current. The condenser pressure,
when the condenser is discharged being zero, the current enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1086" id="Page_1086">[Pg 1086]</a></span>
at maximum velocity as at A in fig. 1,327, and gradually decreases
to zero as the condenser pressure rises to maximum at B,
this change taking place in one-quarter period. Thus the
condenser pressure, which opposes the current, being at a maximum
when the current begins its cycle is 90&deg; <em>ahead of the current</em>,
as is more clearly seen in the last quarter of the cycle (fig. 1,327).</p>

pressure, and impressed or <em>capacity</em> pressure necessary to overcome the condenser
pressure. The capacity pressure, since it must overcome the condenser pressure, is
equal and opposite to the condenser pressure, that is, the phase difference is 180&deg;. The
condenser pressure being 90&deg; <em>ahead</em> of the current, the impressed pressure is 90&deg; <em>behind</em>
the current.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the phase relation between the condenser
pressure and the pressure applied to the condenser
to overcome the condenser pressure?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The pressure applied to the condenser to overcome the
condenser pressure, or as it is called, the <em>capacity pressure</em>, must
be opposite to the condenser pressure, or 90&deg; <em>behind the current</em>.</p>

<p>In circuits containing resistance and capacity, the total
pressure impressed on the circuit, or <em>impressed pressure</em>, as it is
called, is made up of two components:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1087" id="Page_1087">[Pg 1087]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Circuits Containing Resistance, Inductance, and Capacity.</strong>&mdash;When
the three quantities resistance, inductance, and
capacity, are present in a circuit, the combined effect is easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1093" id="Page_1093">[Pg 1093]</a></span>
understood by remembering that inductance and capacity
always act oppositely, that is, they tend to neutralize each other.
Hence, in problems involving the three quantities, the resultant
of inductance and capacity is first obtained, which, together
with the resistance, is used in determining the final effect.</p>

<p>Capacity introduced into a circuit containing inductance
reduces the latter and if enough be introduced, inductance will
be neutralized, giving a resonant circuit which will act as though
only resistance were present.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the expression for impedance of a circuit

<p>Ans. It is equal to <em>the square root of the sum of the resistance
squared plus the square of inductance reactance minus capacity
reactance.</em></p>

<p>This is expressed plainer in the form of an equation as follows:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII<br />

THE POWER FACTOR</h2>


<p>The determination of the power in a direct current circuit is
a simple matter since it is only necessary to multiply together the
volts and amperes to obtain the output in watts. In the case of
alternating current circuits, this holds true only when the current
is in phase with the pressure&mdash;a condition rarely found in practice.</p>

<p>When the current is not in phase with the pressure, the product
of volts and amperes as indicated by the voltmeter and ammeter
must be multiplied by a coefficient called the <em>power factor</em> in
order to obtain the <em>true watts</em>, or actual power available.</p>

<p>There are several ways of defining the power factor, any of
which requires some explanation. The power factor may be
defined as: <em>The number of watts indicated by a wattmeter, divided
by the apparent watts</em>, the latter being the <em>watts as measured
by a voltmeter and ammeter</em>.</p>

<p>The power factor may be expressed as being equal to</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What are the true watts?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The watts as measured by a wattmeter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1102" id="Page_1102">[Pg 1102]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. What are the apparent watts?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The watts obtained by multiplying together the simultaneous
voltmeter and ammeter readings.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is usually meant by power factor?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The multiplier used with the apparent watts to determine
how much of the power supplied is available.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,343.</span>&mdash;Marine analogy of power factor. A ferry boat in crossing a river to a slip C
would head for some point B up stream from C to allow for the effect of the tide. Under
such conditions the actual motion (referred to the water) would be from A to B, and the
apparent motion, from A to C. Accordingly, the energy expended in propelling the boat
from A to B in still water, will propel it from A to C when the tide is running in the direction
of the arrow. The effect of the tide is the same as that of inductance or capacity in
an alternating circuit, that is, it puts the applied force or thrust (impressed volts) out of
phase with the motion of the boat (amperes), this phase difference being indicated by the
angle BAC or &#966;. Now, <em>work</em> (watts) is the product of two factors, pressure (volts) and distance
(amperes); accordingly, the apparent work done in propelling the boat from A to C is
the product of the <em>thrust of the paddle wheels multiplied by</em> AC, which in analogy corresponds
to the product of voltmeter and ammeter readings at the alternator, called "kva." Actually,
however, the power is only applied from A to B, the boat being carried sidewise by the
tide, as it crosses, a distance BC which represents no energy expended by the paddle wheels.
In analogy, the actual power, expended in propelling boat from A to B corresponds to
the wattmeter reading in an alternating current power circuit. To obtain the actual
work done on the boat, the product of its apparent motion&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;thrust must be multiplied
by a coefficient or <em>power factor</em> because the thrust is applied at an angle to the apparent
motion, the power factor being equal to the cosine of this angle, (&#966;) or AB&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;AC.
Similarly, when there is phase difference between pressure and alternating current, the
voltmeter and ammeter readings must be multiplied by the power factor or cos &#966; to give
the output of an alternator available for external work, the excess power indicated by
ammeter and voltmeter readings, performing no external work, but causing objectionable
heating of the alternator.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. Upon what does the power factor depend?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Upon the relative amounts of resistance inductance and
capacity contained in the circuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1103" id="Page_1103">[Pg 1103]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. How does the power factor vary in value?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It varies from one to zero.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The power factor, as will be shown later, is equal to <em>the cosine of the
angle of phase difference</em>; its range then is from one to zero because
these are the limiting values of the cosine of an angle (neglecting the
+ or-sign).</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the effect of lag or lead of the current
on the power factor?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It causes it to become less than one.</p>

shown, the same scale is used for all curves. This as a rule, makes the power curve
inconveniently high, hence it is usually drawn to smaller scale as in fig. 1,345.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>How to Obtain the Power Curve.</strong>&mdash;Since under any phase
condition, the power at any instant is equal to the product of the
pressure multiplied by the current at that instant, a curve may
be easily plotted from the pressure and current curves, giving the

<p><strong>Ques. What should be noticed about the power curve?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Its position with respect to the zero line; it lies wholly
above the zero line which denotes that all the power delivered to
the circuit except that dissipated by friction is useful, that is, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1107" id="Page_1107">[Pg 1107]</a></span>
power factor is unity. Hence, <em>to keep the power factor as near
unity as possible is one of the chief problems in alternating current
distribution</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Can the power factor be less than unity if the
current and pressure be in phase?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Yes, if the waves of current and voltage be distorted
as in fig. 1,348.</p>

<p><strong>Effect of Lag and Lead.</strong>&mdash;In an alternating circuit the
amount of power supplied depends on the phase relationship
of the current and pressure. As just explained, when there is
synchronism of current and pressure, that is, when they are in
phase (as in fig. 1,346) the power factor is unity, assuming no
distortion of current and pressure waves. In all other cases the
power factor is less than unity that is, <em>the effect of lag or lead is
to make the power factor less than unity</em>.</p>

Suppose the waves of current and voltage to be in phase, but distorted in form, and not
symmetrical, so that they do not run uniformly together, as shown in the figure. Then
the real power factor may not be unity, although indicated as such by the power factor
meter. However, the switchboard instruments are made to show the angle of lag as the
power factor, because the error due to wave distortion is generally too small to be considered.</p></div>

<p>The effect of lag on the power factor may be illustrated by
fig. 1,349, in which the angle between the pressure and current,
or the angle of lag is taken as 40&deg;, corresponding to a power
factor of .766. Plotting the power curve from the products
of instantaneous volts and amperes taken at various points, the
power curve is obtained, a portion of which lies below the horizontal
line. The significance of this is that at certain times, the
current is flowing in the opposite direction to that in which the
impressed pressure would send it. During this part of the period
conditions are reversed, and the power (indicated by the shaded
area), instead of being supplied by the source to the circuit, is
being supplied by the circuit to the source.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,351.</span>&mdash;Steam engine analogy of power factor. The figure represents an indicator card
of an engine in which the steam distribution is such that the steam is expanded below
the back pressure line, that is below the pressure of the exhaust. This results in <em>negative
work</em> which must be overcome by the <em>momentum</em> or <em>kinetic energy</em> previously stored in
the fly wheel, and which is represented on the diagram by the shaded loop S. If the
exhaust valve had opened at G, the amount of work done during the revolution would be
represented by the area M, but continuing the expansion below the back pressure line,
the work done is M - S. This latter case as compared with the first when expansion
does not continue below the back pressure line gives an efficiency (power factor) of (M - S)
&divide; M, the shaded area representing so much loss.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This condition is exactly analogous to the case of a steam engine,
expanding the steam below the back or exhaust pressure, a condition
sometimes caused by the action of the governor in considerably reducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1110" id="Page_1110">[Pg 1110]</a></span>
the cut off for very light load. An indicator diagram of such steam
distribution is shown in fig. 1,351. This gives a negative loop in the
diagram indicated by the shaded section.</p>

<p>It must be evident that the average pressure of the shaded loop portion
of the diagram must be subtracted from that of the other portion,
because during the expansion below the exhaust pressure line, the
back pressure is in excess of the forward pressure exerted on the piston
by the expanding steam, and the engine would accordingly reverse its
motion, <em>were it not for the energy previously stored up in the fly wheel</em> in
the form of <em>momentum</em>, which keeps the engine moving during this period
of back thrust. Evidently the shaded area must be subtracted from
the positive area to obtain the net work done during the stroke.
Hence following the analogy as far as possible if M work (watts) be
done during each revolution (cycle) when steam does not expand below
back pressure (when current and pressure are in phase), and S negative
work (negative watts) be done when steam expands below back pressure
(when there is lag), the efficiency (power factor) is (M - S)&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;M.</p></div>

factor is zero. By noting that the curve projects equally on each side of the zero line,
the + power areas equal the negative power areas, hence the summation of these areas for
the period is zero, that is, the two + areas minus the two shaded areas equal zero. It
should be noted that the line of average power WW', which is visible in the other figures,
here coincides with the zero line, and the average power then is zero, since the positive
part above the zero line is equal to and offsets the negative (shaded) part below the line.
This is the case of "wattless" current and (considering a circuit with resistance so small
that it may be considered as zero) shows plainly the possibility of having full load current
and voltage on a circuit yet delivering no power, the current simply surging to and fro
without an actual transfer of power.</p></div>

<p><strong>"Wattless Current;" Power Factor Zero.</strong>&mdash;When the
power factor is zero, it means that the phase difference between
the current and the pressure is 90&deg;.</p>

<p>The term <em>wattless current</em>, as understood, does not indicate an
absence of electrical energy in the circuit; its elements are there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1111" id="Page_1111">[Pg 1111]</a></span>
but not in an available form for external work. The false power
due to the so called wattless current pulsates in and out of the
circuit without accomplishing any useful work.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An example of wattless current, showing that the power factor is zero
is illustrated in fig. 1,353. Here the angle of lag is 90&deg;, that is, the current
is 90&deg; behind the pressure.</p>

<p>The power curve is constructed from the current and pressure curves,
and, as shown in the diagram, it lies as much below the zero line
as above, that is, the two plus power areas which occur during each
period are equal to the two negative (shaded) power areas, showing
that the circuit returns as much energy as is sent out. Hence, the total
work done during each period is zero, indicating that although a current
be flowing, this current is not capable of doing external work.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. Is the condition as just described met with in
practice?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. No.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Why not?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The condition just described involves that the circuit
have no resistance, all the load being reactance, but it is impossible
to have a circuit without some resistance, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1112" id="Page_1112">[Pg 1112]</a></span>
resistance may be made very small in comparison to the reactance
so that a close approach to wattless current is possible.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Give some examples where the phase difference
is very nearly 90&deg;.</strong></p>

<p>Ans. If an alternator supplies current to a circuit having a very
small resistance and very large inductance, the current would
lag nearly 90&deg; behind the pressure. The primary current of a
transformer working with its secondary on an open circuit is a
practical example of a current which represents very little energy.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. When the phase difference between the current

<p><strong>Ques. Does the power factor apply to capacity reactance
in the same way as to inductance reactance?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Yes. The angles of lag and of lead, are from the
practical standpoint, treated as if they lay in the first quadrant
of the circle. Even the negative sign of the tangent &#966; when it
occurs is simply used to determine whether the angle be one of
lag or of lead, but in finding the value of the angle from a table
it is treated as a positive quantity.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. In introducing capacity into a circuit to increase
the power factor what should be considered?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The cost and upkeep of the added apparatus as well
as the power lost in same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1118" id="Page_1118">[Pg 1118]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. How is power lost in a condenser?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The loss is principally due to a phenomenon known as
<em>dielectric hysteresis</em>, which is somewhat analogous to magnetic
hysteresis. The rapidly alternating charges in a condenser placed
in an alternating circuit may be said to cause alternating polarization
of the dielectric, and consequent heating and loss of energy.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. When is inductance introduced into a circuit
to increase the power factor?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. When the phase difference is due to an excess of capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Prove that the power factor is unity when there
is no resultant reactance in a circuit.</strong></p>

<p>Ans. When there is no reactance, tan &#966; which is equal to
reactance&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;resistance becomes 0&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;R&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. The angle &#966;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1119" id="Page_1119">[Pg 1119]</a></span>

0 degrees. Hence, the power factor which is equal to cos &#966; =
cos 0&deg;&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.</p>

is no resultant reactance in the circuit, that is, when the circuit is resonant or has only
resistance. The power factor is equal to the cosine of the angle of lag (or lead). In the
figures this angle is BAC or &#966; and the value of the <em>natural cosine</em> AC gives the power
factor. By inspection of the figures, it is evident that decreasing the reactance decreases
the angle &#966; and increases cos &#966; or the power factor. The circular arc in each figure being
at unity distance from the center A, the power factor with decreasing reactance evidently
approaches unity as its limit, this limit being shown in fig. 1,365 where the reactance

<p><strong>Ques. What is the usual value of the power factor in

<p>Ans. Slightly less than one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1120" id="Page_1120">[Pg 1120]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. Why is it desirable to keep the power factor
near unity?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Because with a low power factor, while the alternator
may be carrying its full load and operating at a moderate temperature,
the consumer is paying only for the actual watts which
are sent over the line to him.</p>

circuits. The instruments are connected as shown and by means of the double throw
switch can be put on either the non-inductive or inductive circuit. First turn switch to
left so that current passes through the lamps; for illustration, the following readings are
assumed: ammeter 10, voltmeter 110, and wattmeter 1,100. The power factor then is
wattmeter reading&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;volts&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;amperes&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,100 actual watts&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;1,100 apparent watts&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,
that is, on non-inductive circuit the power factor is unity. Now throwing the switch to the
right connecting instruments with the inductive circuits, then for illustration the following
readings may be assumed: ammeter 8, voltmeter 110, and wattmeter 684. Now, as
before, power factor&nbsp;=&nbsp;wattmeter reading&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;volts&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;amperes&nbsp;=&nbsp;684&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;(8&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;110)&nbsp;=&nbsp;684

<p>For instance, if a large alternator supplying 1,000 kilowatts at 6,600
volts in a town where a number of induction motors are used on the
line be operating with a power factor of say .625 during a great portion
of the time, the switchboard instruments connected to the alternator will
give the following readings:</p>

<p>Voltmeter 6,600 volts; ammeter 242.4 amperes; power factor meter .625.</p>

<p>The apparent watts would equal 1,600,000 watts or 1,600 kilowatts,
which, if multiplied by the power factor .625 would give 100,000,000 watts
or 1,000 kilowatts which is the actual watts supplied. The alternator
and line must carry 242.4 amperes instead of 151 amperes and the difference
242.4 - 151&nbsp;=&nbsp;91.4 amperes represents a <em>wattless current</em> flowing in
the circuit which causes useless heating of the alternator.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1121" id="Page_1121">[Pg 1121]</a></span>
<p>The mechanical power which is required to drive the alternator is equivalent
to the actual watts produced, since that portion of the current which
lags, is out of phase with the pressure and therefore requires no energy.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. How are alternators rated by manufacturers in
order to avoid disputes?</strong></p>

many kilovolt amperes instead of kilowatts.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is a kilovolt ampere (kva)?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. A unit of apparent power in an alternating current
circuit which is equal to one kilowatt when the power factor is
equal to one.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The machine mentioned on page <a href="#Page_1120">1,120</a> would be designed to carry 151
amperes without overheating and also carry slight overloads for short
periods. It would be rated as 6.6 kilo volts and 151 amperes which
would equal approximately 1,000 kilowatts when the power factor is
1 or unity, and it should operate without undue heating. Now the
lower the power factor becomes, the greater the heating trouble will
be in trying to produce the 1,000 actual kilowatts.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,368</span>&mdash;Curves illustrating <em>power factor</em>. In a circuit having no capacity or inductance,
the power is given by the product of the respective readings of the voltmeter and ammeter,
as in the case of a direct current. In the case of a circuit having capacity or inductance,
this product is higher than the true value as found by a wattmeter, and is known as the
<em>apparent watts</em>. The ratio <em>true watts</em>&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;<em>apparent watts</em> is known as the power factor. The
current flowing in an inductive circuit, such as the primary of a transformer, is really
made up of two components, as already explained, one of which (the load or active component),
is in phase with the pressure, while the other the magnetizing component, is at
right angles to it, that is, it attains its crest value when the other is at zero, and vice
versa. To illustrate, take a complete cycle divided into 360 degrees and lay out on it
the current required to correspond to a given load on the secondary of a transformer,
say a crest value of 100 amperes, and at right angles to this lay out the current required
for exciting the magnetic circuit of the transformer, giving A, merely for purposes of
illustration, a crest value of 25 amperes. Combining these curves, the dotted curve in
the figure is obtained and which represents the resultant current that would be indicated
by an ammeter placed in the primary circuit of the transformer. It will be noted that this
current attains its maximum at a point 14&deg; 2&acute; later than the load current, giving the angle
of lag. Multiplying the apparent watts by the cosine of the angle of lag gives the true watts.
Now assuming the diagram to show the full load condition of the transformer, the angle
of lag being 14&deg; 2&acute;, the power factor at full load is .97 (.97 being the value of the natural
cosine of 14&deg; 2&acute; as obtained from table, such as on page 451). With no external load on
the transformer, the load component of the current is that necessary to make up the core
losses. For instance, at 5 amperes, while the magnetizing current remains as before at
25 amperes, the angle of lag becomes 78&deg; 41&acute; and the power factor .196. It is thus seen
that in transformers, induction motors, etc., the power factor is a function of the load.</p></div>

connected as shown. Then, true watts&nbsp;=&nbsp;(A<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;A<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;(V/R)<sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;R&nbsp;/&nbsp;2. If the volt
meter V take an appreciable amount of current, it may be tested as follows: disconnect
R and V at Y, and see that A and A<sub>1</sub> are alike; then connect R and V at Y again, and
disconnect the load. A<sub>1</sub> will equal current taken by R and V in parallel.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. When is the power factor meter of importance
in station operation, and why?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. When rotary converters are used on alternating current
lines for supplying direct currents and the sub-station operators
are kept busy adjusting the field rheostat of the rotary to maintain
a high power factor and prevent overheating of the alternators
during the time of day when there is the maximum demand
for current or the peak of the load.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIX<br />

ALTERNATORS</h2>


<p><strong>Use of Alternators.</strong>&mdash;The great increase in the application
of electricity for supplying power and for lighting purposes in
industry, commerce, and in the home, is due chiefly to the
economy of distribution of alternating current.</p>

<p>Direct current may be used to advantage in densely populated
districts, but where the load is scattered, it requires, on account
of its low voltage, too great an investment in distributing lines.
In such cases the alternator is used to advantage, for while commutators
can be built for collecting direct current up to 1,000
volts, alternators can be built up to 12,000 volts or more, and
this voltage increased, by step up transformers of high economy,
up to 75,000 or 100,000 volts. Since the copper cost is inversely
as the square of the voltage, the great advantage of alternating
current systems is clearly apparent.</p>

<p>The use of alternating current thus permits a large amount
of energy to be economically distributed over a wide area from
a single station, not only reducing the cost of the wiring, but
securing greater economy by the use of one large station, instead
of several small stations.</p>

<p>The higher voltages generated by alternators enables the transmission
of electrical energy to vastly greater distances than possible
by a direct current system, so that the energy from many
waterfalls that otherwise would go to waste may be utilized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1126" id="Page_1126">[Pg 1126]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Classes of Alternator.</strong>&mdash;There are various ways of classifying
alternators. They may be divided into groups, according to:
1, the nature of the current produced; 2, type of drive; 3,
method of construction; 4, field excitation; 5, service requirements,
etc.</p>

<p>From these several points of view, alternators then may be
classified:</p>

<p>1. With respect to the current, as:</p>


<ul><li><em>a.</em> Single phase;</li>
<li><em>b.</em> Polyphase.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. With respect to the type of drive, as:</p>


<ul><li><em>a.</em> Belt or chain driven;</li>
<li><em>b.</em> Direct connected.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. With respect to construction, as:</p>


<ul><li><em>a.</em> Revolving armature;</li>
<li><em>b.</em> Revolving field;</li>
<li><em>c.</em> Inductor.</li>
<li>        Homopolar and heteropolar.</li>
</ul>

<p>4. With respect to mode of field excitation, as:</p>


<ul><li><em>a.</em> Self-exciting;</li>
<li><em>b.</em> Separately excited;</li>
<li>          Exciter direct connected, or gear driven.</li>
<li><em>c.</em> Compositely excited.</li>
</ul>

<p>5. With respect to service requirements, as:</p>


<ul><li><em>a.</em> Slow speed;</li>
<li><em>b.</em> Fly wheel;</li>

<p><strong>Single Phase Alternators.</strong>&mdash;As a general rule, when alternators
are employed for lighting circuits, the single phase machines
are preferable, as they are simpler in construction and
do not generate the unbalancing voltages often occurring in
polyphase work.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,370.</span>&mdash;Elementary four pole single phase alternator. It has four "inductors" whose
pitch is the same as the pole pitch. They are connected in series and terminate at the
two collector rings as shown. The poles being alternate N and S, it is evident that there
will be two cycles of the current per revolution of the armature. For any number of
poles then the number of cycles equals the number of poles divided by two. Applying
Fleming's rule for induced currents, the direction of the current induced in the inductors
is easily found as indicated by the arrows. The field magnets are excited by coils supplied
with direct current, usually furnished from an external source; for simplicity this is not
shown. The magnets may be considered as of the permanent type.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. What are the essential features of a single phase
alternator?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Fig. 1,370 shows an elementary single phase alternator.
It consists of an armature, with single phase winding, field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1128" id="Page_1128">[Pg 1128]</a></span>
magnets, and two collector rings and brushes through which the
current generated in the armature passes to the external circuit.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. In what respect do commercial machines differ
mostly from the elementary alternator shown in fig.
1,370, and why?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. They have a large number of poles and inductors in
order to obtain the desired frequency, without excessive speed,
and electromagnets instead of permanent magnets.</p>

is here shown as a flat surface upon which a complete view of the winding is seen.
If M be any position of an inductor, by projecting up to the curve gives N, the corresponding
value of the current or pressure. Magnetic lines are shown at the poles representing
a field decreasing in intensity from a maximum at the center to zero at points half way
between the poles, this being the field condition corresponding to the sine form of wave.
In actual machines the variation from the sine curve is considerable in some alternators.
See figs. 1,247 and 1,248.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. In actual machines, why must the magnet cores
be spaced out around the armature with considerable
distance between them?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. In order to get the necessary field winding on the cores,
and also to prevent undue magnetic leakage taking place, laterally
from one limb to the next of opposite sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1129" id="Page_1129">[Pg 1129]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. Is there any gain in making the width of the
armature coils any greater than the pole pitch, and why?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. No, because any additional width will not produce
more voltage, but on the contrary will increase the resistance
and inductance of the armature.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,372.</span>&mdash;Elementary four pole two phase alternator. The winding consists of one inductor
per phase per pole, that is, four inductors per phase, the inductors of each phase being
connected in series by the "connectors" and terminating at the collector rings. This
arrangement requires four collector rings, giving two independent circuits. The pitch of
the inductors of each phase is equal to the pole pitch, and the phase difference is equal to
one-half the pole pitch, that is, phase B winding begins at B, a point half-way between
inductors A and A' of phase A winding. Hence when the current or pressure in phase A
is at a maximum, in the ideal case, when inductor A for instance is under the center of a
pole, the current or pressure in B is zero, because B is then half-way between the poles.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Polyphase Alternators.</strong>&mdash;A multiphase or polyphase alternator
is one which delivers two or more alternating currents
differing in phase by a definite amount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1130" id="Page_1130">[Pg 1130]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For example, if two armatures of the same number of turns each be
connected to a shaft at 90 degrees from each other and revolved in a
bipolar field, and each terminal be connected to a collector ring, two
separate alternating currents, differing in phase by 90 degrees, will be
delivered to the external circuit. Thus a two phase alternator will
deliver two currents differing in phase by one-quarter of a cycle, and
similarly a three phase alternator (the three armatures of which are
set 120 degrees from each other) will deliver three currents differing in
phase by one-third of a cycle.</p>

<p>In practice, instead of separate armatures for each phase, the several
windings are all placed on one armature and in such sequence that the
currents are generated with the desired phase difference between them
as shown in the elementary diagrams 1,372 and 1,373 for two phase
current, and figs. 1,374 and 1,375 for three phase current.</p></div>

The complete winding for the three phases are here visible, the field magnets being
represented as transparent so that all of the inductors may be seen. By applying Fleming's
rule, as the inductors progress under the poles, the directions and reversals of current
are easily determined, as indicated by the sine curves. It will be seen from the curves
that four poles give two cycles per revolution. Inductors A, and B are lettered to
correspond with fig. 1,372, with which they should be compared.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What use is made of two and three phase
current?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. They are employed rather for power purposes than for
lighting, but such systems are often installed for both services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1131" id="Page_1131">[Pg 1131]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. How are they employed in each case?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. For lighting purposes the phases are isolated in separate
circuits, that is, each is used as a single phase current. For
driving motors the circuits are combined.</p>

only three rings are employed, as previously explained. The inductors have distinctive
coverings for the different phases. The arrows indicate the direction in which the induced
pressures tend to cause currents.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the difficulty encountered in starting a

<p>Ans. A single phase current requires either a synchronous

motor of dual type, the idea of which is to provide a
method of getting rotation by foreign means and then to throw
in the single phase current for power.</p>

phase winding 30 degrees. A six phase winding can be made
out of a three phase winding by disconnecting the three phases
from each other, uniting their middle points at a common junction,
as shown by diagram fig. 1,376. This will give a star
grouping with six terminals.</p>

<p>In the case of a mesh grouping, each of the three phases must
be cut into two parts and then reconnected as shown in fig.
1,377.</p>

<p><strong>Belt or Chain Driven Alternators.</strong>&mdash;The mode in which
power is transmitted to an alternator for the generation of current
is governed chiefly by conditions met with where the
machine is to be installed.</p>

<p>In many small power stations and isolated plants the use of
a belt drive is unavoidable. In some cases the prime mover
is already installed and cannot be conveniently arranged for
direct connection, in others the advantage to be gained by an
increase in speed more than compensates for the loss involved
in belt transmission.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p1135a.jpg" width="700" height="359" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,380.</span>&mdash;Belt-driven alternator. By use of a belt, any desired speed ratio is obtained,
enabling the use of a high speed alternator which, being smaller than one of slow speed, is
cheaper. It affords means of drive for line shaft and has other advantages, but requires
considerable space and is not a "positive" drive. Belting exerts a side pull which results
in friction and wear of bearings. Means for tightening the belt as shown in fig. 1,381,
or equivalent, must be provided.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are many places where belted machines may be used
advantageously and economically. They are easily connected
to an existing source of power, as, for instance, a line shaft used
for driving other machinery, and for comparatively small installations
they are lower in first cost than direct connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1136" id="Page_1136">[Pg 1136]</a></span>
machines. Moreover, when connected to line shaft they are
run by the main engine which as a rule is more efficient than
a small engine direct connected.</p>

<p>Where there is sufficient room between pulley centers, a belt
is a satisfactory medium for power transmission, and one that
is largely used. It is important that there be liberal distance
between centers, especially in the case of generators or motors
belted to a medium or slow speed engine, because, owing to the
high speed of rotation of the electric machines, there is
considerable difference in their pulley diameters and the drive
pulley diameter; hence, if they were close together, the arc of
contact of the belt with the smaller pulley would be appreciably
reduced, thus diminishing the tractive power of the belt.</p>

moves the machine along the base.</p>

in practically all cases. The above rule corresponds to a pull of 33 lbs. per inch of width.
Many designers proportion single belts for a pull of 45 lbs. For double belts of average

10 is to 7. This should not be applied to the above rule for single belts, as it will give an

It is a positive drive, that is, there can be no slip. Less liability
of becoming detached, and, because it is not dependent on

less than pulley diameter for belt drive.</p>

frequent cleaning; climbing of teeth when links and teeth become

</div>

<p><strong>Direct Connected Alternators.</strong>&mdash;There are a large number
of cases where economy of space is of prime importance, and to
meet this condition the alternator and engine are direct connected,
meaning, that there is no intermediate gearing such as
belt, chain, etc., between engine and alternator.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One difficulty encountered in the direct connection of engine and
alternator is the fact that the most desirable rotative speed of the engine
is less than that of the alternator. Accordingly a compromise is made
by raising the engine speed and lowering the alternator speed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1142" id="Page_1142">[Pg 1142]</a></span>
<p>The insistent demand for direct connected units in the small and
medium sizes, especially for direct current units, was the chief cause
resulting in the rapid and high development of what is known as the
"high speed automatic engine."</p>

<p>Increasing the engine speed means that more horse power is developed
for any given cylinder dimensions, while reducing the speed of the
generator involves that the machine must be larger for a given output,
and in the case of an alternator more poles are required to obtain a
given frequency, resulting in increased cost.</p>

<p>The compactness of the unit as a whole, simplicity, and general
advantages are usually so great as to more than offset any additional
cost of the generator.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. Could a dynamo be converted into an alternator?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. How can this be done?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. By placing two collector rings on one end of the armature
and connecting these two rings to points in the armature
winding 180&deg; apart, as shown in fig. 1,390.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1145" id="Page_1145">[Pg 1145]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. Would such arrangement as shown in fig. 1,390
make a desirable alternator?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. No.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Alternating current windings are usually different from those used for
direct currents. One distinction is the fact that a simple open coil
winding may be, and often is, employed, but the chief difference is the
intermittent action of the inductors.</p>

<p>In a direct current Gramme ring winding a certain number of coils are
always active, while those in the space
between the pole pieces are not generating.
In this way a practically
steady pressure is produced by a large
fraction of the coils.</p>

<p>In the case of an alternator all of
the coils are either active or inactive
at one time. Hence, the winding
need cover only as much of the armature
as is covered by the pole pieces.</p></div>

<p><strong>Revolving Field Alternators.</strong>&mdash;In generating an electric
current by causing an inductor to cut magnetic lines, it makes
no difference whether the cutting of the magnetic lines is effected
by moving an inductor across a magnetic field or moving the
magnetic field across the inductor.</p>

<p><em>Motion is purely a relative matter</em>, that is, an object is
said to move when it changes its position with some other object
regarded as stationary; it may be moving with respect to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1147" id="Page_1147">[Pg 1147]</a></span>
second object, and at the same time be at rest with respect to
a third object. Thus, a dory has a speed of four miles per hour
in still water; if it be run up stream against a current flowing
four miles per hour it would move at that speed with respect
to the water, yet remain at rest with respect to the earth.</p>

<p>It must be evident then that motion, as stated, being a purely
relative matter, it makes no difference whether the armature
of a generator move with respect to the field magnets, or the
field magnets move with respect to the armature, so far as inducing
an electric current is concerned.</p>

there may be motion something must be regarded as being stationary. In the above illustration
a catboat is shown at anchor in a stream which is flowing at a rate of four miles

per hour against the current is <em>moving</em> at that velocity <em>relative</em> to the current, yet is at a
standstill relative to the catboat. In this instance both catboat and dory are moving
with respect to the water if the latter be regarded as stationary. Again if the earth be
regarded as being stationary, the two boats are at rest and the water is moving relative
to the earth.</p></div>
</div>

<p>For alternators of medium and large size there are several
reasons why the armature should be stationary and the field
magnets revolve, as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1148" id="Page_1148">[Pg 1148]</a></span></p>

<p>1. By making the armature stationary, superior insulation
methods may be employed, enabling the generation of current
at very much higher voltage than in the revolving armature type.</p>

<p>2. Because the difficulty of taking current at very high pressures
from collector rings is avoided.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The field current only passes through the collector rings. Since the
field current is of low voltage and small in comparison with the main
current, small brushes are sufficient and sparking troubles are avoided.</p></div>

</div>

<p>3. Only two collector rings are required.</p>

<p>4. The armature terminals, being stationary, may be enclosed
permanently so that no one can come in contact with them.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What names are usually applied to the armature
and field magnets with respect to which moves?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The "stator" and the "rotor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1149" id="Page_1149">[Pg 1149]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The terms armature and field magnets are to be preferred to such
expressions. An armature is an armature, no matter whether it move
or be fixed, and the same applies to the field magnets. There is no
good reason to apply other terms which do not define the parts.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. Explain the
essential features of
a revolving field alternator.</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The construction
of such alternators
is indicated in the
diagram, fig. 1,394.
Attached to the shaft
is a field core, which
carries the latter, consisting
of field coils
fitted on pole pieces
which are dovetailed
to the field core. The
armature is built into
the frame and surrounds
the magnets as
shown. The field current,
which is transmitted
to the magnets
by slip rings and
brushes, consists
of direct current
of comparatively low
pressure, obtained
from some external
source.</p>

fingers hold the core punchings in place and numerous

frequent intervals to allow free circulation of cool air.
The armature coils are form wound, insulated, and
retained in the core slots by means of wedges.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1150" id="Page_1150">[Pg 1150]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Inductor Alternators.</strong>&mdash;In this class of alternator both
armature and field magnets are stationary, a current being
induced in the armature winding by the action of a so called
inductor in moving through the magnetic field so as to periodically
vary its intensity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p1150a.jpg" width="700" height="369" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 1,396 and 1,397.&mdash;Elementary inductor alternator; diagram showing principle of
operation. It consists of a field magnet, at the polar extremities of which is an armature
winding both being stationary as shown. Inductors consisting of iron discs are arranged
on a shaft to rotate through the air gap of the magnet poles. Now in the rotation of the
inductors, when any one of them passes through the air gap as in fig. 1,396, the reluctance or
magnetic resistance of the air gap is greatly reduced, which causes a corresponding increase
in the number of magnetic lines passing through the armature winding. Again as
an inductor passes out of the air gap as in fig. 1,397, the number of magnetic lines is greatly
reduced; that is, when an inductor is in the air gap, the magnetic field is dense, and when
no inductor is in the gap, the field is weak; a variable flux is thus made to pass through the
armature winding, inducing current therein. The essential feature of the inductor alternator
is that iron only is revolving, and as the design is usually homopolar, the magnetic
flux in its field coils is not alternating, but undulating in character. Thus, with a given
maximum flux through each polar mass, the total number of armature turns required to
produce a given voltage is just twice that which is required in an alternator having an
alternating instead of an undulating flux through its field windings. The above and the
one shown in figs. 1,398 and 1,399 are examples of real inductor alternators, those shown in
the other cuts are simply so called inductor alternators, the distinction being that, as above,
the inductor constitutes no part of the field magnet.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. What influence have the inductors on the field
flux?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. They cause it to undulate; that is, the flux rises to a
maximum and falls to a minimum value, but does not reverse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1151" id="Page_1151">[Pg 1151]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. How does this affect the design of the machine
as compared with other types of alternator?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. With a given maximum magnetic flux through each
polar mass, the total number of armature turns necessary to
produce a given pressure is twice that which is required in an
alternator having an alternating flux through its armature
windings.</p>

T an adjustable hammer which is secured in position by a lock nut N.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. Is the disadvantage due to the necessity of
doubling the number of armature turns compensated
in any way?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Yes, the magnetic flux is not reversed or entirely
changed in each cycle through the whole mass of iron in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1152" id="Page_1152">[Pg 1152]</a></span>
armature, the abrupt changes being largely confined to the
projections on the armature surface between the coils.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What benefit results from this peculiarity?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It enables the use of a very high magnetic flux density
in the armature without excessive core loss, and also the use of
a large flux without an excessive increase in the amount of
magnetic iron.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The use of a large flux permits a reduction in the number of armature
turns, thus compensating, more or less, for the disadvantage due to
the operation of only one-half of the armature coils at a time.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 1,400 and 1,401.&mdash;One form of inductor alternator. As shown, the frame carries the
stationary armature, which is of the slotted type. Inside of the armature is the revolving
inductor, provided with the projections built up of wrought iron or steel laminations.
The circular exciting coil is also stationary and encircles the inductor, thus setting up a
magnetic flux around the path indicated by the dotted line, fig. 1,401. The projecting
poles are all, therefore, of the same polarity, and as they revolve, the magnetic flux sweeps
over the coils. Although this arrangement does away with collector rings, the machines
are not so easily constructed as other types, especially in the large sizes. The magnetizing
coil becomes large and difficult to support in place, and would be hard to repair in
case of breakdown. Inductor alternators have become practically obsolete, except in
special cases, as inductor magnetos used for ignition and other purposes requiring a very
small size machine. The reasons for the type being displaced by other forms of alternator
are chiefly because only half as great a pressure is obtained by a flux of given amount,
as would be obtained in the ordinary type of machine. It is also more expensive to build
two armatures, to give the same power, than to build one armature. This type has still
other grave defects, among which may be mentioned enormous magnetic leakage, heavy
eddy current losses, inferior heat emissivity, and bad regulation.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1153" id="Page_1153">[Pg 1153]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Classes of Inductor Alternator.</strong>&mdash;There are two classes
into which inductor alternators may be divided, based on the
mode of setting of their polar projections:</p>

<p>1. Homopolar machines;</p>

<p>2. Heteropolar machines.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><strong>Homopolar Inductor Alternators.</strong>&mdash;In this type the positive
polar projections of the inductors are set opposite the negative polar
projections as shown in fig. 1,402. When the polar projections are set
in this manner, the armature coils must be "staggered" or set displaced
along the circumference with respect to one another at a distance
equal to half the distance from the positive pole to the next positive pole.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p1153a.jpg" width="700" height="336" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 1,402 and 1,403.&mdash;Homopolar and heteropolar "inductors". Homopolar inductors have
their N and S poles opposite each other, while in the heteropolar type, they are "staggered"
as shown.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><strong>Heteropolar Inductor Alternators.</strong>&mdash;Machines of this class are
those in which the polar projections are themselves staggered, as shown
in fig. 1,403, and therefore, do not require the staggering of the armature
coils. In this case, a single armature of double width may be used, and
the rotating inductor then acts as a <em>heteropolar magnet</em>, or a magnet which
presents alternatively positive and negative poles to the armature,
instead of presenting a series of poles of the same polarity as in the case
of a <em>homopolar magnet</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Inductor Alternators.</strong>&mdash;Morday originally designed and
introduced inductor alternators in 1866. They are not the prevailing
type, as their field of application is comparatively narrow. They have
to be very carefully designed with regard to magnetic leakage in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1154" id="Page_1154">[Pg 1154]</a></span>
to prevent them being relatively too heavy and costly for their output,
and too defective with respect to their pressure regulation, other
defects being heavy eddy current losses and inferior heat conductance.</p></div>

<p><strong>Hunting or Singing in Alternators.</strong>&mdash;Hunting is a term
applied to the state of two parallel connected alternators running
out of step, or not synchronously, that is, "see sawing." When
the current wave of an alternator is peaked and two machines
are operated in parallel it is very difficult to keep them in step,
that is in synchronism. Any difference in the phase relation
which is set up by the alternation will cause a local or synchronizing
current to flow between the two machines and at
times it becomes so great that they must be disconnected.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,404.</span>&mdash;Revolving field of Fort Wayne alternator equipped with <em>amortisseur winding</em>.
The object of this winding is to check any tendency toward <em>hunting</em> when the alternator
is to be run as a synchronous motor, either for rotary condenser or power service. The
amortisseur winding consists of heavy copper bars, placed around and through the pole
faces and short circuited at the ends by heavy copper rings; it serves as a starting winding
to bring the rotor up to speed as an induction motor, and also serves as a damping
device to neutralize any tendency toward "hunting" caused by variation in speed of the
generator supplying the current.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Alternators which produce a smooth current wave and are
maintained at uniform speed by properly designed governors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1155" id="Page_1155">[Pg 1155]</a></span>
operate fairly well in parallel, but are not entirely free from
hunting, and other means are provided to overcome the difficulty.</p>

<p>When heavy copper flanges, called dampers, are put over the
polar projections or copper bars laid in grooves on the pole
face and short circuited by connecting rings (called amortisseur
winding), the powerful induced currents which are produced when
the alternators get out of step tend to quickly re-establish the
phase relation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> NOTE.&mdash;Amortisseur windings are often erroneously called "squirrel cage" windings
on account of similarity of construction. The latter term should be reserved for its proper
significance as being the name of the type of armature winding generally used for induction
motors, the name being suggested by the resemblance of the finished armature to the
wheel of a squirrel cage. A comparison of figs. 1,405 and 1,746 will show the distinction. In a
squirrel cage winding there is a large number of bars uniformly spaced; an amortisseur winding
consists of a comparatively small number of bars, usually unevenly spaced, that is they are
divided into groups with considerable space between the groups, as in fig. 1,405, and less pronounced
in fig. 1,404. The bars are short circuited by rings the same as in squirrel cage winding.</p></div>

connected to one single phase circuit, and the motors are started and operated from this
circuit with the assistance of the teazer wire. The long coil indicates the main winding
of the armature, which is similar in its arrangement and size to the ordinary armature
winding of a single phase alternator. The short coil which connects at one end to the
middle point of the coil above mentioned, and at the other to a third collector ring is called
the "teazer" coil. Its use is to generate a pressure in quadrature with that of the main
coil. This pressure is combined with the main pressure of the alternator by transformers,
so as to give suitable phase relations for operating induction motors. In the diagram
the voltage has been assumed to be 2,080 volts, and the voltages marked to correspond

<p><strong>Monocyclic Alternators.</strong>&mdash;This type of alternator was
designed prior to the introduction of the polyphase systems,
to overcome the difficulties encountered in the operation of single
phase alternators as motors. A single phase alternator will not
start from rest as a motor, but must first be started and brought
up to the proper speed before being connected with single phase
mains. This condition constituted a serious difficulty in all
cases where the motor had to be stopped and started at comparatively
frequent intervals.</p>

A to B, C to D, E to F, and G to H, and connect as shown by dotted lines. The
armature of a standard monocyclic alternator rotates in a counter clockwise direction
facing the commutator. When the alternator is loaded, the voltage between the teazer
coil and the two terminals of the main coil may be different; therefore, it is necessary to
have the commutator connected in corresponding ends of the main coil. If the machine
has not been arranged for clockwise rotation, the following change in the connections on
the commutator-collector must be made if the machine is to be run in parallel with another.
Fig. 1,410 shows the connections of monocyclic alternators. In fig. 1,409, the studs on the
commutator-collector marked 1 and 6 are the terminals of the main coil. These should

<p><strong>Armature Reaction.</strong>&mdash;Every conductor carrying a current
creates a magnetic field around itself, whether it be embedded
in iron or lie in air. Armature inductors, therefore, create
magnetic fluxes around themselves, and these fluxes will, in
part, interfere with the main flux from the poles of the field
magnet. The effect of these fluxes is:</p>

(assuming no self induction) and the field is undisturbed, but, as the inductors pass under
a pole face as in fig. 1,412, current is induced in them, and lines of force are set up as indicated
by the dotted lines. This distorts the main field so that the lines of force are
crowded toward the forward part of the pole face as shown.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. Explain how the field becomes distorted by
armature reaction.</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Considering a slotted armature and analyzing the
electrical conditions as the inductors move past a pole piece, it
will be observed: 1, when the coil is in the position shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1161" id="Page_1161">[Pg 1161]</a></span>
fig. 1,411, the current will be zero, assuming no armature self-induction,
consequently for this position the armature coil has
no disturbing effect upon the field set up by the field magnet;
2, when the inductors have moved under the pole face, as in
fig. 1,412, currents will be induced in them, and they will tend
to set up a magnetic field as indicated by the dotted lines, and
in direction, by the arrow heads. The effect of this field will be
to distort the main field, strengthening one side of the pole and
weakening the other side.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,413.</span>&mdash;Section of armature and field showing <em>weakening effect</em> of armature reaction in
the field. Self-induction being present (as it almost always is), the current lags more or
less behind the pressure, so that when the coil is in the position of zero induction, as shown,
the current has not yet come to rest. Accordingly, lines of force (indicated by the dotted
lines) are set up by the current flowing through the coils which are in opposition to the
field, thus weakening the latter. The dots and crosses in inductor sections, have their
usual significance in defining the direction of current, representing respectively the heads
and tails of arrows.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. Explain how the field becomes weakened by
armature reaction.</strong></p>

<p>Ans. In all armatures there is more or less inductance
which causes the current to lag behind the pressure a corresponding
amount. Accordingly, the current does not stop flowing
at the same instant that the pressure becomes zero, therefore,
when the coil is in the position of zero pressure, as in fig. 1,413,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1162" id="Page_1162">[Pg 1162]</a></span>
the current is still flowing and sets up a magnetic field which
opposes the main field as indicated by the dotted arrows, thus
weakening the main field.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. In what kind of armature is this effect especially
pronounced?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. In slotted armatures provided with coils of a large
number of turns.</p>

the current leads the pressure. If the circuit contain an excess of capacity the current will
lead the pressure, so that when the coil is in the position of zero induction, as shown,
the current will have come to rest and reversed. Accordingly, lines of force (indicated by
the dotted lines) are set up by the current flowing through the coil and which are in the
same direction as the lines of force of the field, thus strengthening the latter.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figs. 1,416 to 1,425.</span>&mdash;Diagrams illustrating superposition of fields. In the figures magnetic curves representing the effect of
the armature currents in several different cases are superposed upon the magnetic curves assumed to be due to the
field magnet. The uppermost line shows the primary field due to the exciting coils on the magnet poles. They are
shown passing into the armature teeth in two principal positions, where the middle of a pole is: 1, opposite a tooth, and
2, opposite a slot. In the second line is shown the field due to the armature currents assuming no lag, and that the
magnets are not excited. If there be no lag, the places of strongest current will be opposite the poles. As shown in
the right hand figure when the current in one phase C, is at its maximum, those in the other phases A and B will be of
half strength. In the left hand figure when the current in one phase B, is at its zero value, those in the other phases will
be of equal value, or 87 per cent. of the maximum. In the third line is shown the effect of superposing these fields due
to the current upon those due to the magnets as depicted in the first line. Inspection of this resultant field shows how
the armature current distorts the field without altering the total number of lines per pole. In the fourth and fifth lines
are shown the effects of a lagging current. A lag of 90&deg; is assumed; and in that case the maximum current occurs in
any inductor one quarter period after the pole has passed, or at a distance of half a pole pitch behind the middle point
of the pole, as in the fourth line. When these armature fields are superposed on those of the magnets in the first line
the resultant fields are those depicted in the fifth line. On inspection it will be seen that in this case there is no distortion,
but a diminution of the flux from each pole, as the lines due to the armature currents, tending to pass through the pole
cores in the sense opposite to those of the primary magnetism, must be deducted from the total. The twelve lines per pole
are correspondingly reduced to eight; and, of these eight, four go astray constituting a leakage field. This illustrates the
effect of a lagging current in demagnetizing the field magnets and in increasing the dispersion.</p></div>

<p>same as the normal frequency. In both cases the eddy currents which
are set up, produce a marked increase in the load losses, and thus tend
to give the machine a higher temperature rise on single phase loading.</p>

<p>Designers continue to be singularly heedless of these single phase
reactions, resulting in many cases of unsatisfactory single phase
alternators. Single phase reactions distort the wave form of the
machine.</p>

<p><strong>Three Phase Reactions.</strong>&mdash;The action of the three phase currents
in an alternator is to produce a resultant field which is practically uniform,
and which revolves in synchronism with the field system. The
resultant three phase reaction, because of its uniformity, produces no
great increase in the load losses of the machine, the small additional
losses which are present being due to windings not being placed actually
in space at 120&deg;, and to the local leakage in the teeth.</p></div>

</div>

<p><strong>Magnetic Leakage.</strong>&mdash;In the design of alternators the drop
of voltage on an inductive load is mainly dependent upon the
magnetic leakages, primary and secondary. They increase with
the load, and, what is of more importance, they increase with
the fall of the power factor of the circuit on which they may be
working. This is one reason why certain types of alternator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1166" id="Page_1166">[Pg 1166]</a></span>
though satisfactory on a lighting circuit, have proved themselves
unsatisfactory when applied to a load consisting chiefly
of motors.</p>

<p>The designer must know the various causes which contribute
to leakage and make proper allowance.</p>

<p>In general, to keep the leakage small, the pole cores should
be short, and of minimum surface, the pole shoes should not
have too wide a span nor be too thick, nor present needless
corners, and the axial length of the pole face and of the armature
core should not be too great in proportion to the diameter of the
working face.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 1,427 and 1,428.&mdash;Diagram showing respectively the character of stray field between adjacent
straight poles, and between adjacent poles with shoes. Across the slightly V-shaped
spaces the stray field passes in lines that, save near the outer part, are nearly straight.
Quite straight they would not be, even were the sides parallel, because the difference of
magnetic pressure increases from the roots towards the pole ends. At the roots, where the
cores are attached to the yoke, the magnetic pressure difference is almost zero. It would
be exactly zero if there were not a perceptible reluctance offered by the joints and by the
metal of the yoke. The reluctance of the joint causes a few of the lines to take paths
through the air by a leakage which adds to the useful flux. At the tops of the cores there
is a difference of magnetic pressure equal to the sum of the ampere turns on the two
cores, tending to drive magnetic lines across. This difference of magnetic pressure increases
regularly all the way up the cores from root to top; hence, the average value may be taken
as equal to the ampere turns on one core. The stray field, therefore, will steadily increase
in density from the bottom upwards. In addition to this stray field between the pole
cores there is also a stray field between the projecting tips or edges of the pole shoes, as
shown in fig. 1,428. In some machines the dispersion due to the pole shoes is greater
than that between the flanks of the cores.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To keep the increase of leakage between no load and full load
from undue magnitude, it is required that armature reactions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1167" id="Page_1167">[Pg 1167]</a></span>
shall be relatively small, that the peripheral density of the armature
current (ampere-conductors per inch) be not too great, and
that the pole cores be not too highly saturated when excited for
no load.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,429.</span>&mdash;Lincoln revolving field alternator. The frame has openings for ventilation, the
fanning action of the pole pieces causing a current of air to pass not only over the end of
the windings, as is usual with other designs, but also through ventilating slots in the
windings themselves. The armature core laminations are annealed after punching and
before assembling to guard against the crystalizing effect of the punching. The armature
coils are form wound and insulated before being placed in the slot. There is also slot
insulation which is put in the slot previous to inserting the coil. When the winding is completed,
it is tested with a pressure of 4 to 10 times the normal voltage of the machine. The
bearings are self-aligning. The machine is normally designed to operate at a power factor
of approximately 70 per cent., which means that at that power factor, the armature and
fields at full load will heat equally. If it have a higher power factor than 70 per cent. it
means that the field windings will run considerably cooler than the armature windings
with full load. If the power factor be lower than this, it will mean that the field windings
will run hotter than the armature on full load; however, the machine is designed so that
harmful heating does not occur on full load with greater power factor than 40 per cent.</p></div>

<p><strong>Field Excitation of Alternators.</strong>&mdash;The fields of alternators
require a separate source of direct current for their excitation,
and this current should be preferably automatically controlled.
In the case of alternators that are not self exciting, the dynamo
which generates the field current is called the <em>exciter</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The excitation of an alternator at its rated overload and .8 power
factor would not, in some cases, if controlled by hand, exceed 125 volts,
although, in order to make its armature voltage respond quickly to
changes in the load and speed, the excitation of its fields may at times be
momentarily varied by an automatic regulator between the limits of 70
and 140 volts.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,430.</span>&mdash;Western Electric armature for self-excited alternator. The main winding is placed
at the bottom of the slots, each coil being surrounded by an armour of horn fibre. The
exciter winding occupies a very small portion of the slot, being placed on top of the main
winding, and connected to the commutator immediately in front of the core and between
core and collector rings as shown.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The exciter should, in turn, respond at once to this demand upon its
armature, and experience has shown that to do this its shunt fields
must have sufficient margin at full load to deliver momentarily a
range from 25 to 160 volts at its armature terminals.</p>

<p>It is obvious from the above that an exciter suitable for use with an
automatic regulator must commutate successfully over a wide range in
voltage, and, if properly designed, have liberal margins in its shunt
fields and magnetic circuits.</p>

<p>Alternator fields designed for and operated at unity power factor
have often proved unsatisfactory when the machines were called upon
to deliver their rated kva. at .8 power factor or lower. This is due to
the increased field current required at the latter condition and results,
first, in the overheating of the fields and, second, in the necessity of
raising the direct current exciting voltage above 125 volts, which often
requires the purchase of new exciters.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What is a self-excited alternator?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. One whose armature has, in addition to the main
winding, another winding connected to a commutator for furnishing
direct field exciting current, as shown in fig. 1,430.</p>

<p>Ans. The exciter armature is mounted on the shaft of the

sufficient to permit a pedestal and bearing to be mounted between
the exciter and hub. In other designs the exciter is
placed between the bearing and hub.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the disadvantage of a direct connected

<p><strong>Slow Speed Alternators.</strong>&mdash;By slow speed is here understood
relatively slow speed, such as the usual speeds of reciprocating
engines. A slow speed alternator is one designed to run at a
speed slow enough that it may be direct connected to an engine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1173" id="Page_1173">[Pg 1173]</a></span>
Such alternators are of the revolving field type and a little consideration
will show that they must have a multiplicity of field
magnets to attain the required frequency.</p>

<p>In order that there be room for the magnets, the machine
evidently must be of large size, especially for high frequency.</p>

effect needed for close speed regulation.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>EXAMPLE.&mdash;How many field magnets are required on a two phase
alternator direct connected to an engine running 240 revolutions per
minute, for a frequency of 60?</p>

<p>An engine running 240 revolutions <em>per minute</em> will turn</p>

<p>240&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;60&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 revolutions <em>per second</em>.</p>

<p>A frequency of 60 requires</p>

<p>60&nbsp;&divide;&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;15 cycles per phase per revolution, or</p>

<p>15&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;30 poles per phase.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1174" id="Page_1174">[Pg 1174]</a></span>
Hence for a two phase alternator the total number of poles required is</p>

<p class="center">30&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;60.
</p>

<p>It is thus seen that a considerable length of spider rim is required to
attach the numerous poles, the exact size depending upon their dimensions
and clearance.</p></div>

The alternators have direct connected exciters which are plainly seen in the illustration
placed on an extension of bearing pedestal. Direct connected exciters on units of this kind
do not, as a rule, assume too bulky proportions, because of the high engine speed.</p></div>

<p><strong>Fly Wheel Alternators.</strong>&mdash;The diameter of the revolving
fields on direct connected alternators of very large sizes becomes
so great that considerable fly wheel effect is obtained, although
the revolutions be low. By giving liberal thickness to the rim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1175" id="Page_1175">[Pg 1175]</a></span>
of the spider, the rotor then answers the purpose of a fly wheel,
hence no separate fly wheel is required. In fact, the revolving
element resembles very closely an ordinary fly wheel with magnets
mounted on its rim, as illustrated in fig, 1,437.</p>

<p><strong>High Speed Alternators.</strong>&mdash;Since alternators may be run at
speeds far in excess of desirable engine speeds, it must be evident
that both size and cost may be reduced by designing them
for high speed operation.</p>

<p>Since the desired velocity ratio or multiplication of speed is
so easily obtained by belt drive, that form of transmission is
generally used for high speed alternators, the chief objection
being the space required. Accordingly where economy of space
is not of prime importance, a high speed alternator is usually
installed, except in the large sizes where the conditions naturally
suggest a direct connected unit.</p>

<p><strong>Water Wheel Alternators.</strong>&mdash;In order to meet most successfully
the requirements of the modern hydro-electric plant, the
alternators must combine those characteristics which result in
high electrical efficiency with a mechanical strength of the
moving elements which will insure uninterrupted service, and
an ample factor of safety when operating at the relatively high
speeds often used with this class of machine.</p>

direct connection to water wheel. Owing to the wide range in output of the generating
units and also in the speed at which they must operate to suit varying conditions of head,
types of wheels used, and other features pertaining to water power developments, it has
been necessary to design a very complete line of machines for this work. The bearings
are of the ring oiling type with large oil reservoirs.</p></div>

<p>When selecting an alternator for water wheel operation a
careful analysis of the details of construction should be made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1178" id="Page_1178">[Pg 1178]</a></span>
order to determine the relative values which have been assigned
by the designers to the properties of the various materials used.
Such analysis will permit the selection of a type of machine best
adapted to the intended service and which possesses the required

<p>The large use of electric power transmitted by means of high
pressure alternating current has led to the development of a large
number of water powers and created a corresponding demand
for alternators suitable for direct connection to water wheels.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Why?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Because water wheel alternators are frequently required
to operate safely at speeds considerably in excess of normal.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,441.</span>&mdash;Allis-Chalmers revolving field for water wheel alternator. In this type of alternator
it is essential that the rotating part be designed to have a liberal factor of safety
not only at the ordinary operating speed, but also at speeds much in excess of normal.
Frequently machines are required to operate safely at a speed 50 to 75 per cent. in excess
of normal, so that there may be no danger in case the water wheel races. In most
machines the field spider is of steel cast in a single piece for the smaller alternators and in
two or more parts for the larger sizes. For alternators running at high peripheral speed,
the rim is built up of steel laminations supported by a cast steel spider; the latter serves
merely to rotate the rim, which is in itself able to withstand all stresses due to the high speed.
The field poles are laminated, being built up of steel punchings held between malleable
iron or bronze end plates, the latter being used on high speed machines. With but very
few exceptions the poles are attached by dovetail projections that fit into corresponding
slots. Steel tapered keys are driven in alongside the dovetails, and the pole pieces cannot
become loose. All field coils, except on a few of the smallest machines, are of edgewise
wound copper strip. This style of coil is essential for revolving field alternators where
the pressure on the insulation, due to centrifugal force, is so great that cotton insulation
on round wire will not stand. Current is led into the rings by means of carbon brushes,
the number of brushes being such that the current density at the rubbing contact is kept
within conservative limits. At least two brushes per ring are always provided so that
one can be removed for inspection without interrupting the exciting current. In large
machines the brush holder studs are mounted on a stand supported from the base; in
small alternators they are usually fastened to the cap of one of the bearing pedestals.</p></div>

special provision

<p><strong>Turbine
Driven Alternators.</strong>&mdash;Although
the principle of
operation of the
steam turbine
and that of the
reciprocating engine
are decidedly
unlike, the principle
of operation
of the high speed
turbine driven alternator
does not
differ from that
of generators designed
for being
driven by other
types of engine
or by water
wheels. There

speed machines must be very different from those permissible
in generators of much slower speeds.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. How does a turbine rotor differ from the ordinary
construction?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It is made very small in diameter and unusually long.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Why?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. To reduce vibration and centrifugal stresses.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What are the two classes of turbine driven
alternators?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. They are classed as vertical or horizontal.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. How do they compare?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The vertical type requires less floor space than the
horizontal design, and while a step bearing is necessary to carry
the weight of the moving element, there is very little friction
in the main bearings.</p>

<p>The horizontal machine, while it occupies more space, does not
require a step bearing.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Describe a step bearing.</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It consists of two cylindrical cast iron plates bearing
upon each other and having a central recess between them into
which lubricating oil is forced under considerable pressure by
a steam or electrically driven pump, the oil passing up from
beneath.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><strong>Alternators of Exceptional Character.</strong>&mdash;There are a few types
of alternator less frequently encountered than those already described.
The essentials of such machines are here briefly given.</p>

<p><strong>Asynchronous Alternators.</strong>&mdash;In these machines, the rotating
magnet, which, with definite poles, is replaced by a rotor having closed
circuits. In general construction, they are similar to asynchronous
induction motors having short circuited rotors; for these alternators,
when operating as motors, run at a speed slightly below synchronism
and act as generators when the speed is increased above that of synchronism.
Machines of this class are not self-exciting, but require an
alternating or polyphase current previously supplied to the mains to
which the stationary armature is connected.</p>

<p>Asynchronous alternators may be advantageously used in central
stations that may be required to sustain a very sudden increase of load.
In such cases, one or more asynchronous machines might be kept in
operation as a non-loaded motor at a speed just below synchronism
until its output as a generator is required; when by merely increasing
the speed of the engine it will be made to act as a generator, thus avoiding
the delays usually occurring before switching in a new alternator.</p>

<p><strong>Image Current Alternators.</strong>&mdash;When the generated frequency of
alternators excited by low frequency currents is either the sum or the
difference of the excitation and rotation frequencies, any load current
flowing through the armature of the machine is exactly reproduced in
its field circuit. These reproduced currents are characteristic of all
types of asynchronous machines, and are called "image currents," as
they are actually the reflection from the load currents delivered by the
armature circuit.</p>

<p>As the exciter of a machine of this type carries "<em>image currents</em>"
proportional to the generated currents, its size must be proportional to
the capacity of the machine multiplied by the ratio of the excitation
and generated frequencies; therefore, in the commercial machines, the
excitation frequency is reduced to the minimum value possible; from
two to five cycles per second being suitable for convenient employment.</p>

<p>These machines as heretofore constructed are not self-exciting, but
as the principle of image current enables the construction of self-exciting
alternators, it will be of advantage to have a general understanding
of the separately excited machine under different conditions
of excitation.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1184" id="Page_1184">[Pg 1184]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1446.</span>&mdash;Diagram of constant pressure image current alternator connections. The image
or reproduced currents are characteristic of all types of asynchronous machines, and are
called image currents because they are actually the reflection from the load currents delivered
by the armature circuit. The principle of operation is explained in the accompanying
text.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1185" id="Page_1185">[Pg 1185]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the generated frequency of the machine is equal to the difference
of the excitation and rotation frequencies, the magnetization of the
machine is higher under a non-inductive load than under no load. This
is principally due to the ohmic resistance of the field circuit, which
prevents the image current from entirely neutralizing the magnetomotive
force of the armature current. In other words, the result of the
magnetomotive force of the armature and image currents not only tends
to increase the no load magnetization of the machine at non-inductive
load, but depresses the original magnetization at inductive load, so
that the terminal voltage of the machine increases with non-inductive
load, and decreases with inductive load.</p>

<p>Again, the generated frequency is equal to the sum of the excitation
and rotation frequencies, the resistance of the field circuit reacts
positively; that is, it tends to decrease the magnetization, and consequently
the terminal voltage of the machine at both inductive and
non-inductive loads.</p>

<p>In the constant pressure machine, the two effects are combined and
opposed to one another.</p>

<p>The connections of two alternators with diphase excitation are shown
by fig. 1,446.</p>

<p><strong>Extra High Frequency Alternators.</strong>&mdash;Alternators generating currents
having a frequency up to 10,000 or 15,000 cycles per second have
been proposed several times for special purposes, such as high frequency
experiments, etc. In 1902 Nikola Tesla proposed some forms of alternators
having a large number of small poles, which would generate
currents up to a frequency of 15,000 cycles per second.</p>

<p>Later, the Westinghouse Company constructed an experimental
machine of the inductor alternator type for generating currents
having a frequency of 10,000 cycles per second. This machine was
designed by Samms. It had 200 polar projections with a pole pitch
of only 0.25 inch, and a peripheral speed of 25,000 feet per minute.
The armature core was built up of steel ribbon 2 inches wide and 3 mils
thick. The armature had 400 slots with one wire per slot, and a bore of
about 25 inches. The air gap was only 0.03125 inch. On constant excitation
the voltage dropped from 150 volts at no-load to 123 volts with
an output of 8 amperes.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Exciting Image Current Alternators.</strong>&mdash;The type of machine
described in the preceding paragraph can be made self-exciting by
connecting each pair of brushes, which collect the current from the
armature, with a field coil so located that the flux it produces will be
displaced by a predetermined angle depending on the number of phases
required, as shown by fig. 1,447. The direction of the residual magnetism
of the machine is shown by the arrows A, A.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,447.</span>&mdash;Diagram of connections of self-exciting image current alternator.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the armature is rotated, a pressure will be generated between
the brushes 2 and 4, and a current will flow from C through the coils
XX to B, producing a flux through the armature at right angles to the
residual magnetism and establishing a resultant magnetic field between
D, B, and D, C. This field will generate a pressure between the brushes
1 and 3, and a current will flow D through XX to E in such a direction
that it will at first be opposed to the residual magnetism, and afterward
reverse the direction of the latter. At the moment the residual magnetism
becomes zero, the only magnetism left in the machine will be due
to the currents from the brushes 2 and 4, and their field combining with
the vertical reversed field will produce a resultant polar line between
B and E. As these operations are cyclic, they will recur at periodic
intervals, and the phenomena will become continuous. The negative
field thus set up in the air gap of the machine will cut the conductors
of the stator and will be cut by the conductors of the rotor in such a
manner that the electromotive forces generated between the brushes
of the armature will be equal and opposite to those between the terminals
of the stator.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER L<br />

CONSTRUCTION OF ALTERNATORS</h2>


<p>The construction of alternators follows much the same lines
as dynamos, especially in the case of machines of the revolving
armature type. Usually, however, more poles are provided than
on direct current machines, in order to obtain the required frequency
without being driven at excessive speed.</p>

<p>The essential parts of an alternator are:</p>


<ul><li>1. Field magnets;</li>
<li>2. Armature;</li>
<li>3. Collector rings;</li>
</ul>

<p>and in actual construction, in order that these necessary parts
may be retained in proper co-relation, and the machine operate
properly there must also be included:</p>


<ul><li>4. Frame;</li>
<li>5. Bed plate;</li>
<li>6. Pulley.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Field Magnets.</strong>&mdash;The early forms of alternator were built
with permanently magnetized steel magnets, but these were
later discarded for electromagnets.</p>

<p>Alternators are built with three kinds of electromagnets,
classed according to the manner in which they are excited, the
machines being known as,</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is a self-excited alternator?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. One in which the field magnets are excited by current
from one or more of the armature coils, or from a separate winding
(small in comparison with the main winding), the current being
transformed into direct current by passing it through a commutator.</p>

windings, one for the main current, and one for the exciting current. The winding for
the latter current occupies a very small amount of space, and is placed in the slots on top
the main winding. The commutator to which the exciter winding is connected, is located
between the collector rings and the core. It is of standard construction with end clamps
holding the bars in place on the insulated commutator drum. The armature coils are
form wound and the core is built of sheet steel laminations, annealed and japanned to
prevent hysteresis and eddy current losses. Ventilated openings are provided to allow a
free circulation of air both around the ends of the windings and through ducts in the
laminated core. The core is clamped by bolts between the flanges of the armature spider
which is keyed to the shaft. These flanges have cylindrical extensions with ribbed surfaces,
which form a support for the ends of the armature coils. The ribbed surfaces form air
passages from the core outward around the ends of the coils, thus ventilating both core
and coils.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,454.</span>&mdash;Allis-Chalmers three bearing type alternator with exciter direct connected. The bearing pedestals are bolted to a
substantial cast iron base having, in the large sizes, sufficient length to permit shifting frame sideways along the base to
give access to the field and armature coils. The field coils are designed for 120 volt excitation, and are wound edgewise
with copper strip. There is a liberal margin of field excitation to take care of overloads or for operation on loads of low
power factor. The regulating qualities are as good as can be obtained without making the machine unnecessarily large and
expensive. By regulation is meant the percentage rise in voltage when full load is thrown off, field excitation and speed
being held constant; the percentage is referred to normal full load voltage. An alternator with poor regulation will show
large variations in voltage with changes in load, the pressure falling whenever a load is thrown on and rising when it is
thrown off. These changes will be especially pronounced if the load be inductive. A badly designed alternator might show
very fair regulation on non-inductive load and yet be unable to give full voltage on inductive load.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1191" id="Page_1191">[Pg 1191]</a></span></p>

<p>Ans. They are employed in small power plants and isolated
lighting plants where inductive loads are encountered.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is a separately excited alternator?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. One in which the field magnets are excited from a small
dynamo independently driven or driven by the alternator shaft,
either direct connected or by belt as shown in fig. 1,455.</p>

direct current, usually at 125 volts pressure by a small dynamo called the "exciter." The
latter may be driven by independent power, or by belt connection with the main shaft,

</div>

<p><strong>Ques. What is a compositely excited alternator?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. A composite alternator is similar to a compound wound
dynamo in that it has two field windings. In addition to the
regular field coils which carry the main magnetizing current from
the exciter, there is a second winding upon two or upon all of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1192" id="Page_1192">[Pg 1192]</a></span>
pole pieces, carrying a rectified current from the alternator which
strengthens the field to balance the losses in the machine, and
also if so desired, the losses on the line as shown in fig. 1,456.</p>

magnets is obtained, partly from an exciter and partly from the windings of the alternator,
being transformed into direct current by the rectifier. The connections are as shown.
One end of the armature winding is connected to one of the collector rings; the other end,
to the light part of the rectifier, as shown, the solid black part of the rectifier being
connected to the other collector ring. Two brushes bear on adjacent teeth of the rectifier
and are connected to the compensating winding circuit across which is a shunt. These
connections are shown more clearly in fig. 1,457. In operation the separately excited
coils set up the magnetism necessary for the generation of the voltage at no load. The
main current coming from the armature is shunted, part going through the shunts and
the remainder around the compensating winding, furnishing the additional magnetism
necessary to supply the voltage to overcome the armature impedance. This composite
method of field excitation is very similar to that used on a compound wound dynamo.
As shown, both field windings encircle every pole, but in some machines the rectified
current will traverse a few poles only, the current from the exciter traversing the remainder.</p></div>

alternator. The rectifier consists of two castings M and S with teeth which fit together
as shown, being insulated so they do not come in contact with each other. Every alternate
tooth being of the same casting is connected together, the same as though joined by a
conducting wire. There are as many teeth as there are poles. One end of the armature
winding is connected direct to one of the collector rings, while the other is connected to M of
the rectifier, the circuit being through brushes P and Q, the shunt, and compensating winding
to the other collector ring. The brushes P and Q contact with adjacent teeth, when one
is in contact with the solid black casting the other touches the light casting. The
principle of action is the same as a commutator, briefly: to reverse the connections terminating
at the brushes P and Q in synchronism with the reversals of the alternating
current induced in the armature winding, thus obtaining direct current for the compensating
field winding. The shunt resistance placed across the compensating winding circuit permits
adjusting the compounding of the machine to the circuit on which it is to work, since
by varying the resistance the percentage of the total current passing through the compensating
winding can be changed. It will be seen by tracing the path of the current for
each direction in the armature winding that while the rectifier causes the current to flow
in the same direction in the compensating field winding, it still remains alternating in the
external circuit.</p></div>

<p>Ans. Stationary and revolving.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the usual construction of stationary
field magnets?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Laminated pole pieces are used, each pole being made
up of a number of steel stampings riveted together and bolted or
preferably cast into the frame of the machine. The field coils are
machine wound and carefully insulated. After winding they
are taped to protect them from mechanical injury. Each coil is
then dipped in an insulating compound and afterwards baked
to render it impervious to moisture.</p>

switches on the field frame in order that the field circuit may be broken up to eliminate

<p><strong>Ques. Describe the
construction of a revolving
field.</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The entire
structure or rotor consists
of a shaft, hub or
spider, field magnets and
slip rings. The magnet
poles consist of laminated
iron stampings
clamped in place by
means of through bolts
which, acting through
the agency of steel end
plates, force the laminated
stampings into a
uniform, rigid mass.
This mass is magnetically
subdivided into so
many small parts that
the heating effect of
eddy currents is reduced
to a minimum. The cores
are mounted upon a hub
or spider either by dovetail
construction or by
means of through bolts,
according to the centrifugal
force which they
must withstand in operation,
either method permitting
the easy removal
of any particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1198" id="Page_1198">[Pg 1198]</a></span>
field pole if necessary. The field coils are secured upon the
pole pieces either by horns in one piece with the laminations,
or separate and bolted. All the coils are connected in series,
cable leads connecting them to slip rings placed on the shaft.</p>

the notched ends of the pole pieces are slid into the grooves in the hub, tapered keys,
which are plainly seen, are driven in, thus making a tight joint which will not shake loose.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. What are slip rings?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Insulated rings mounted upon the alternator shaft to
receive direct current for the revolving field, as distinguished
from collector rings which collect the alternating currents
generated in an alternator of the revolving armature type.</p>

the pole face so as to secure not only a wide polar arc
for the proper distribution of the magnetic flux, but
also to hold the field windings in place.</p></div>

<p>The current is introduced

</div>

<p><strong>Ques. What
form of spider is
used on large alternators?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It is practically
the same form
as a fly wheel, consisting
of hub, spokes,
and rim to which the
magnets are bolted.</p>

<p><strong>Armatures.</strong>&mdash;In construction, armatures for alternators are
similar to those employed on dynamos; they are in most cases
simpler than direct current armatures due to the smaller number
of coils, absence of commutator with its multi-connections, etc.
Alternator armatures may be classified in several ways:</p>

<p>1. With respect to operation, as</p>


<ul><li><em>a.</em> Revolving;</li>
<li><em>b.</em> Stationary.</li>

brush holder and slip
rings. The latter are
made of cast copper,
which the builders
claim to be more satisfactory
than cast iron.
On some of the large
low speed machines the
collector rings are split,
but on the majority of
alternators they are in
one piece. Current is led
into the rings by means
of carbon brushes, the
number of brushes being
such that the current
density at the rubbing
contact is kept
within conservative
limits. At least two
brushes per ring are
provided, so that one
can be removed for inspection
without interrupting
the exciting
current. In large machines
the brush holder
studs are mounted on
a stand supported from
the base; on small alternators
they are usually
fastened to the cap of
one of the bearing pedestals.</p></div>

revolving armature alternator,
designed for use in
small power plants and isolated
lighting plants where inductive
loads are encountered. Built
for pressures of 120, 240, 480,
and 600 volts. These voltages
have been recommended by the
American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, and will cover the
needs of any set of conditions
ordinarily met with. These
standard voltages not only permit
economical distribution, but
they are such that no transformers
are necessary to reduce
the line pressure for ordinary
cases. For transmitting
power relatively long distances,
600 volts is usually employed.
Where there is a demand for
480 volt service, a 480 volt alternator
should be selected and
if lower voltages are also desired
an auto-transformer may be
furnished by means of which
240 volts can be obtained. When 120 volt circuits are necessary for lighting, etc., the
240 volt pressure can be still further reduced to 120 volts by means of another auto-transformer.
However, this double reduction will rarely be found necessary.</p></div>

The latter type is now almost universally used, the others being practically obsolete. A Gramme ring wound and connected
to collector rings as in fig. 1,474, will yield an alternating current. In a multipolar field, the ring will need multipolar connections
alternated at points corresponding to the pitch of the poles. Fig. 1,475 illustrates the so-called "Siemens" disc
armature. The armature coils are arranged around the periphery of a thin disc. The field magnets consist of two crowns
of fixed coils, with iron cores arranged so that their free poles are opposite one another. This type was created in 1878
by Herr von Hefner, engineer to Messrs. Siemens and Halske. Fig, 1,476 shows a modern drum armature of a three
phase machine. It is similar in appearance to a direct current armature except for the absence of the commutator and

the copper inside the ring
is inactive.</p>

<p>Disc armatures were employed
by Pacinotti in
1878, and afterwards
adopted by Brush in his
arc lighting dynamos.</p>

<p>The design failed for mechanical
reasons, but electrically
it is, in a sense, an
improvement upon the
Gramme ring, in that inductors
on both sides of
the ring are active, these
being connected together

<p>this, projecting metal pieces called <em>driving horns</em> were fixed into the core so as to
take the pressure, but they proved unsatisfactory. This defect together with the
long air gap necessary in smooth core construction resulted in the type being displaced
by slotted core armatures.</p>

<p>A slotted core is one whose surface is provided with slots or teeth which carry
the inductors, as shown in the accompanying illustrations, and is the type almost
universally used. The inductors are laid in the slots, the sides and bottoms of which

insulating material.</p></div>

<p>Ans. The teeth protect the inductors, retain them in place
against the electrical drag and centrifugal force, and the construction
permits a reduction of air gap to a minimum, thus reducing
the amount of copper required for the field.</p>

capacity alternators the frame castings are usually divided into upper and lower sections.
<strong>The skeleton type</strong> consists of two side castings between which substantial spacing
rods are set at regular intervals. The core consists of the usual sheet iron lamination
slotted and assembled; they are mounted on the inner periphery of the frame, making
lap joints (that is "staggered" as in fig. 1,480), each section being dovetailed to the frame.

<p><strong>Armature Windings.</strong>&mdash;In general, the schemes for armature
windings for alternators are simpler than those for direct current
machines, as in the majority of cases the inductors are an even
multiple of the number of poles, and the groupings are usually
symmetrical with respect to each pole or each pair of poles. Furthermore,
as a general rule, all the inductors of any one phase are in
series with one another; therefore, there is only one circuit per
phase, and this is as it should be, since alternators are usually
required to generate high voltages. These general principles
establish the rule, that in the circuit in a single phase armature,
and in the individual circuits in a polyphase armature, the
winding is never re-entrant, but the circuits have definite endings
and beginnings. In exceptional cases, as those of polyphase
converters, re-entrant circuits are employed, and the armature
windings are so constructed that a commutator can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1208" id="Page_1208">[Pg 1208]</a></span>
connected to them exactly as in direct current machines.
These armatures are usually of the lap wound drum type.</p>

of ducts formed by suitable spacing blocks inserted at intervals between the laminations,
as shown here and in fig. 1,484. The armature coils are form wound and designed so they
can be readily replaced in case of injury. They are taped and treated with an impregnating
compound, in the usual way, then inserted in the armature slots in an armour of
horn fibre and retaining wedges of wood are dovetailed into the slot walls.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Alternator windings are usually described in terms of the
number of slots per phase per pole. For instance, if the armature
of a 20 pole three phase machine have 300 slots, it has 15 slots
per pole or 5 slots per each phase per pole, and will be described
as a five slot winding. Therefore, in order to trace the connections
of a winding, it is necessary to consider the number of slots
per pole for any one phase on one of the following assumptions:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1209" id="Page_1209">[Pg 1209]</a></span>
1, that each slot holds one inductor; 2, that there is one side
of a coil in each slot; and 3, that one side of a coil is subdivided
so as to permit of its distribution in two or more adjacent slots.</p>

<p>The voltage depends upon the number of inductors in a slot,
but the breadth coefficient and wave form are influenced by the
number of slots per pole, and not by the number of inductors
within the slots.</p>

additional support is provided by means of an insulated metal ring, to which the outer

the load or short circuits. The figure shows a section of a supporting ring of this type

replacement of damaged coils, sufficient space is usually provided between the alternator
bearings to allow ample movement of the armature to permit of ready access to both armature
and field coils. Where space necessitates the use of a short shaft, access to the windings
may be had by disconnecting some of the coils and lifting the upper half of the armature.</p></div>

<p><strong>Classification of Windings.</strong>&mdash;The fact that alternators are
built in so many different types, gives rise to numerous kinds of
armature winding to meet the varied conditions of operation.
In dividing these forms of winding into distinctive groups, they
may be classified, according to several points of view, as follows:</p>

<p>1. With respect to the form of the armature, as:</p>


<ul><li><em>a.</em> Revolving;</li>
<li><em>b.</em> Stationary.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. With respect to the mode of progression, as:</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,485.</span>&mdash;Section of Western Electric stationary armature core showing laminations clamped
in place, and ventilating ducts. The stator or stationary armature consists of soft iron
laminations assembled in the magnet frame with stator coils embedded in the core slots.
The laminations are punched separately and then carefully annealed to reduce hysteresis
losses. After annealing, a coat of japan is applied, effectively preventing the flow of eddy
currents in the assembled core. The frame is cast iron and of the box type construction.
The frames of the smaller sizes are cast in one piece, while frames of the larger sizes are
split to facilitate installation. Large openings are provided in the box type frame, in order
to improve the ventilation. The laminations are securely held in place in the frame by
heavy end rings and by steel clamping fingers which are firmly bolted to the frame. The
outer circumference of the core is dovetailed to the frame, and the inner circumference is
slotted to receive the windings. The alignment of the slots is insured by means of metal
wedges, and no filing is done on the slots, so that each lamination is always insulated from
the next one. Numerous ventilating ducts allow the free circulation of cool air through
and around the coils. The open slot construction is employed and the coils are fitted into
insulating troughs which offer excellent mechanical and electric protection. The coils
are held in place by suitable wedges.</p></div>

revolving or stationary according as the armature forms the
rotor or stator of the machine.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the significance of the terms lap and
wave as applied to alternator windings?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. They have the same meaning as they do when applied
to dynamo windings.</p>

<p>These are described in detail in Chapter XVIII. Briefly a lap winding
is one composed of lap coils; a wave winding is one which roughly
resembles in its diagram, a section of waves.</p></div>

<p><strong>Half Coil and Whole Coil Windings.</strong>&mdash;The distinction as
to whether the adjacent sides of consecutive coils are placed
together under one pole or whether they are separated a distance
equal to the pole pitch, gives rise to what is known as half coil
and whole coil windings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1214" id="Page_1214">[Pg 1214]</a></span></p>

<p>A half coil or hemitropic winding is <em>one in which the coils
in any phase are situated opposite every other pole</em>, that is, <em>a
winding in which there is only one coil per phase</em> <strong>per pair of
poles</strong>, as in fig. 1,488.</p>

<p><em>A whole coil winding is one in which there is one coil per phase</em>
<strong>per pole</strong>, as in fig. 1,489, the whole (every one) of the poles
being subtended by coils.</p>

there is one coil per phase <em>per pole</em>.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Concentrated or Uni-Coil Winding.</strong>&mdash;Fig. 1,492 shows
the simplest type of single phase winding. It is a one slot
winding and is sometimes called "monotooth" or "uni-coil"
winding. The surface of the armature is considered as divided
into a series of large teeth, one tooth to each pole, and each tooth
is wound with one coil, of one or more turns per pole. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1215" id="Page_1215">[Pg 1215]</a></span>
all the turns of the coil are placed in single slots, the winding is
called "concentrated."</p>

indicate the path of the winding. A half coil or hemitropic winding has a slightly higher reactance than a winding in which
two distinct coils are used in the same slot, one going forward and the other backward. The most usual three phase windings
are of the half coil type as the three sets of coils are equispaced over a pair of poles.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1216" id="Page_1216">[Pg 1216]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Ques. What are the features of concentrated windings?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Cheap construction, maximum voltage for a given
number of inductors. Concentrated windings have greater
armature reaction and inductance than other types hence the
terminal voltage of an alternator with concentrated winding
falls off more than with distributed winding when the current
output is increased. An alternator, therefore, does not have as
good regulation with concentrated winding as with distributed
winding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 1,492 and 1,493.&mdash;Concentrated windings. A concentrated winding is one in which the
armature has only <em>one tooth per phase per pole</em>, that is, the number of teeth equals the number
of poles. A concentrated winding of the half coil type has only one side of a coil in each
slot as in fig. 1,492. In the whole coil variety, each slot contains neighboring sides of
adjacent coils, as in fig. 1,493. In construction, wedges are generally used for retaining the
half coils, and with whole coils the teeth have projecting horns for this purpose.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. What should be noted with respect to concentrated
windings?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. A concentrated winding, though giving higher voltage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1217" id="Page_1217">[Pg 1217]</a></span>
than the distributed type with no load, may give a lower voltage
than the latter at full load.</p>

machines having concentrated whole coil windings. The manner of assembling the coils

</div>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the wave form with a concentrated
winding?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The pressure curve rises suddenly in value as the
armature slots pass under the pole pieces, and falls suddenly as
the armature slots recede from under the pole pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Distributed or Multi-Coil Windings.</strong>&mdash;Instead of winding
an armature so it will occupy only one slot per phase per pole,
it may be spread out so as to fill <em>several slots per phase per pole</em>.
This arrangement is called a distributed winding.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To illustrate, fig. 1,496 represents a coil of say fifteen turns. This
could be placed on an armature just as it is, in which case only one
slot would be required for each side, that is, two in all. In place of
this thick coil, the wire could be divided into several coils of a lesser
number of turns each, arranged as in fig. 1,497; it is then said to be
<em>partially distributed</em>, or it could be arranged as in fig. 1,498, when it is
said to be <em>fully distributed</em>.</p></div>

all the wire is wound in one large coil; in the partially distributed type fig. 1,497, the
wire of fig. 1,496, is wound in two or more coils or "sections" connected as shown, leaving
some space inside not taken up by the subdivisions. In fig. 1,498 the wire of fig. 1,496 is
<em>fully distributed</em>, being wound in a series of coils, so that all the interior space is taken up
by the wire, that is to say, the spaces not occupied by the wire (the teeth when placed on
the armature) are of equal size.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1219" id="Page_1219">[Pg 1219]</a></span></p>

<p>A partially distributed winding, then, is one, as in fig. 1,499,
in which the coil slots do not occupy all the circumference of the
armature; that is, the core teeth are not continuous.</p>

<p>A fully distributed winding is one in which the entire surface
of the core is taken up with slots, as in fig. 1,500.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. In a distributed coil what is understood by the
breadth of the coil?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The distance between the two outer sides, as B in figs.
1,497 and 1,498.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p1219a.jpg" width="700" height="365" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,499.</span>&mdash;Partially distributed winding. Each coil unit is here divided into two concentric
coils of different dimensions and connected in series, as shown in detail in fig. 1,497. This
being a "whole coil" winding the several units are so connected that the winding of adjacent
units proceeds in opposite directions, that is, one coil is wound clockwise, and the
next counter clockwise, etc., so that the induced currents flow in a common direction as
indicated by the arrows for the position shown.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,500.</span>&mdash;Fully distributed winding. In this type of winding each coil consists of so many
sub-coils that the winding occupies the entire surface of the armature core; that is, there
are no extensive spaces unoccupied, the spacing being uniform as shown.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. How far is it advisable to spread distributed
coils of a single phase alternator?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. There is not much advantage in reducing the interior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1220" id="Page_1220">[Pg 1220]</a></span>
breadth much below that of the breadth of the pole faces, nor is
there much advantage in making the exterior breadth greater
than the pole pitch.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Undue spreading of distributed coils lowers the value of the Kapp
coefficient (later explained) by reducing the breadth coefficient and
makes necessary a larger number of inductors to obtain the same voltage.</p>

<p>The increase in the number of inductors causes more armature self-induction.
From this point of view, it would be preferable to concentrate
the winding in fewer slots that were closer together. This, however,
would accentuate the distorting and demagnetizing reactions of the
armature. Accordingly, between these two disadvantages a compromise
is made, as to the extent of distributing the coils and spacing of the
teeth, the proportions assigned being those which experience shows best
suited to the conditions of operation for which the machine is designed.</p></div>

from the monotooth whole coil winding, but if the winding be hemitropic, as in fig. 1,502,
and has coils of two sizes as shown, it will be suitable for high voltages.</p></div>

<p><strong>The Kapp Coefficient.</strong>&mdash;A volt or unit of electric pressure is

<p>This is usually taken as the fundamental equation in designing
alternators. It is, however, deduced on the assumptions that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1222" id="Page_1222">[Pg 1222]</a></span>
the distribution of the magnetic flux follows a sine law, and that the
whole of the loops of active inductors in the armature circuit acts
simultaneously, that is to say, the winding is concentrated.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,503.</span>&mdash;Developed diagram of single phase winding with fully distributed coils. As
explained, excessive spreading lowers the value of the "Kapp" coefficient, and consequently
the voltage; also the use of a larger number of inductors to obtain the same
voltage results in an increase of armature self-induction. On the other hand, if the winding
were concentrated in fewer slots and these slots were closer together, the result will be an
increase in distorting and demagnetizing reactions of the armature. Therefore, a compromise
between these two disadvantages must be made. The common practice is to wind
in two or three slots per pole per phase.</p></div>

excluding moisture and rendering the insulation firm and solid. The ends of the coils,
where they project beyond the slots, are heavily taped.</p></div>

<p>In practice, the coils are often more or less distributed, that
is, they do not always subtend an exact pole pitch; moreover, the
flux distribution, which depends on the shaping and breadth
of the poles, is often quite different from a sine distribution.

it is obvious that the maximum pressure is induced in any inductor as it passes the center of the pole, this variation being
indicated by the heavier dots and crosses toward the center. Now if a number of these inductors be connected up to form
a distributed coil as in fig. 1,507, the pressures induced in each will be added, but all the maximum pressure will not be
induced in all at the same time, hence the total pressure induced in the distributed coil is less than it would be if the coil
were concentrated as in fig. 1,509.</p></div>

<p><strong>Wire, Strap, and Bar Windings.</strong>&mdash;In the construction of

according to which is best suited for the conditions to be met.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What conditions principally govern the type of
inductor?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. It depends chiefly upon the current to be carried and
the space in which the inductor is to be placed.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What kind of inductors are used on machines
intended for high voltage and moderate current?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The winding is composed of what is called <em>magnet wire</em>,
with double or triple cotton insulation.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. Where considerable cross section is required
how is a wire inductor arranged?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. In order that the coil may be flexible several small
wires in multiple are used instead of a single large wire.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. How is the insulation arranged on inductors

<p>Ans. Bare wire is used for the wires in parallel, insulation
being wrapped around them as in fig. 1,510.</p>

of a single phase armature are wound with coils. The reason
for this may be explained by aid of fig. 1,524, which shows an
armature with six slots per pole, four of which are wound.
Owing to the different positions of, say, coils A and B, there will
be a difference in phase between the pressure generated in them
and consequently the resultant pressure of the two coils joined
in series will be less than the sum of the pressure in each coil.</p>

be evident from the illustration, the maximum cross section of copper can be placed in a

to carry a large current. Bar inductors, on account of the shape of their ends, must be
placed in the slots from the top, because the bent ends do not admit of pushing them in.
Straight slots are therefore necessary, the inductors being held in place by wooden strips
and tie bands as shown.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What other advantage besides obtaining a
sine wave is secured by distributing a coil?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. There is less heating because of the better ventilation.</p>

<p><strong>Single Phase Windings.</strong>&mdash;There are various kinds of single
phase winding, such as, concentrated, distributed, hemitropic,
etc. Fig. 1,527 shows the simple type of single phase winding.
It is a "one slot" winding, that is, concentrated coils are used.</p>

<p>The armature has the same number of teeth as there are poles,
the concentrated coils being arranged as shown. In designing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1234" id="Page_1234">[Pg 1234]</a></span>
such a winding, the machine, for example, may be required to
generate, say, 3,000 volts, frequency 45, revolutions 900 per
minute.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These conditions require 720 inductors in series in the armature
circuit, and as the armature is divided into six slots corresponding to
the six poles, there will be 120 inductors per slot, and the coil surrounding
each of the six teeth on the surface of the armature will consist of 60
turns. The connections must be such as to give alternate clockwise
and counter-clockwise winding proceeding around the armature.</p></div>

inductors are required. And in the case of a concentrated or monotooth winding they
may be arranged in "whole coils" as above or in "half coils" (hemitropic) as in fig. 1,528.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. In what other way could the inductors be
arranged in concentrated coils?</strong></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1235" id="Page_1235">[Pg 1235]</a></span></p>

<p>Ans. They could be grouped in three coils of 120 turns each,
as shown in fig. 1,528.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When thus grouped the arrangement is called a hemitropic winding,
as previously explained.</p></div>

but in this case arranged in three instead of six coils. In this winding the direction of
winding is alternately reversed so that the induced pressures do not oppose one another.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. What is the advantage, if any, of a half coil
winding?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. In single phase machines a half coil winding is equivalent,
electrically, to a monotooth winding, and, therefore, is not
of any particular advantage; but in three phase machines, it has
a decided advantage, as in such, a concentrated winding yields
a higher pressure than a distributed winding.</p>

<p>In polyphase working, it is evident that by the use of four equal
independent windings on the armature, connected to eight terminals or
slip rings, a two phase alternator can be built to supply currents of
equal voltage to four independent circuits. Likewise, by the use of
three equal independent windings, connected to six terminals or slip
rings, a three phase alternator can be made to supply three independent
circuits.</p>

<p>This is not the usual method employed in either case, however, as

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,558.</span>&mdash;Diagram of Westinghouse two phase composite wound alternator, showing
connections between two phase armature and a single phase rectified and composite
field winding. The arrangement makes use of a series transformer, mounted on the
spokes of the armature. By means of this series transformer the voltage delivered to
the rectifying commutator and the fields is much less than that generated by the machine.
The armature of this machine is of the closed coil single winding type, all the armature
inductors being connected with each other to form a closed circuit which resembles to
a certain extent the ordinary drum winding of a multipolar direct current machine.
This winding is tapped out at two points per pole just as is the continuous winding of
a two phase rotary converter, these taps running to collector rings through which the
currents are delivered to the outside circuits. On account of this connection of both
phases to one winding there is a definite voltage set up between the inductors of phase
A, and of phase B, this voltage being shown by the figures given in the diagram. The
arrangement is adapted for two phase work by fitting the series transformer for the
auxiliary field excitation with two primaries connected respectively in one leg of each
of the two phases; thus the transformer is excited by two currents normally &frac14; period
out of phase with each other. The result upon the secondary is a combination of the
effects of the two primary currents, the voltage delivered by the secondary being intermediate
in phase between those pressures which would be separately set up by the two
primaries. This combination effect is shown in the small diagram in the upper right
hand corner of the illustration. If OA be the effect set up in the secondary of the series
transformer by the primary current of phase A, and OB be the effect set up by the
primary current of phase B, OC represents in magnitude and phase relation the resultant
effect upon the secondary. It is readily seen that this resultant is not equal to the
arithmetical sum of the two components since, to a certain extent, they work at cross
purposes. However, if either one of them increase the resultant effect increases, although
not in exact proportion. If the load remain balanced, the two components remaining
equal to each other, the resultant OC varies in exact proportion to any changes in the
components. If the load become unbalanced, the resultant swings around more nearly
into phase with the larger load; thus if OB become greater, OA remaining the same,
OC swings around, becoming more nearly horizontal. This requires a readjustment of
the position of the brushes on the commutator to set them properly for minimum sparking,
an adjustment exactly similar to that required when the power factor of the load changes.</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,559.</span>&mdash;Diagram of Westinghouse three phase composite wound alternator. The armature
inductors are of the closed coil or delta connected type, but are tapped at three
points per pair or poles to the three collector rings. All three connections between the
armature coils and the collector rings run through primary circuits of the series transformer
within the armature, these three primaries each giving their own effect upon
the secondary. Since the resultant of three equal alternating electromotive forces 120&deg;
apart is zero, so that some special arrangement must be adopted to make these electromotive
forces act with instead of against each other. The arrangement is a reversal
of the connections of one of the primaries of the series transformer. This is shown in
the case of the lowest primary indicated in the diagram. The combination of the effects
of the three primaries is again indicated in the small vector diagram in the upper right
hand corner. Here OA is the effect of one primary, OB that of another &#8531; of a period
displaced from the former in phase, and OC that which the third would exert were it
not reversed, but the reversal brings the effect of this third coil into the phase relation
OD, so that the three are only 60&deg; apart. The combination of OA and OB is equal
to OC, which combined again with OD gives a resultant effect, OE. In this case, as
in the other, the effect upon the series field does not remain exactly proportional to the
load unless the latter is balanced; in fact, an increased current through the one leg represented
by OD, affects the series field as much as an equal increase in each of the other
legs put together. Practically, however, any increase of the load&mdash;distributed as it must
be in two legs at least&mdash;increases the field excitation so that proper regulation is secured.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. How is the path and value of currents in a delta
connected armature determined?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. Starting with the inductors of one phase opposite the
middle of the poles, assume the maximum current to be induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1254" id="Page_1254">[Pg 1254]</a></span>
at this moment; then but one-half of the same value of current
will be induced at the same moment in the other two phases,
and its path and value will best be shown by aid of fig. 1,560,
in which X may be taken as the middle collector ring, and the
maximum current to be flowing from X toward Z. It will be
seen that no current is coming in through the line Y, but part of
the current at Z will have been induced in the branches <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>.</p>

become unbalanced. Under such circumstances the common return wire is sometimes

winding. This plan of winding is supposed to have some advantage
in keeping coils of different phases further separated
than the two range plan.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,565.</span>&mdash;Section of armature winding of Allis-Chalmers 500 kw. three phase water wheel alternator. The coils
are of the concentrated "half" type. Each coil is completely insulated before being placed on the core and no
insulation is placed in the slot itself. The ends of the coils where they project beyond the slots are heavily taped.
Where necessary suitable supports are provided for the coil connections so that they cannot become displaced on
account of stresses due to short circuits or other causes. The winding is of the "chain" type. This is shown by
the way the coils are connected together at the right. The armature terminals are either provided with insulated
connectors or are led to a marble terminal board on which the terminals are so mounted and protected that
it is impossible for an attendant to make accidental contact with them. The position of the illustration would
indicate a horizontal alternator but the machine is of the vertical type; the lug on the right shows this, being
used for adjusting the alternator on the foundation.</p></div>

<p><strong>Skew Coil Winding.</strong>&mdash;In this type of winding the object is
to shape the coils so that all may be of one pattern. This is
accomplished by making the ends skew shape as shown in
figs. 1,566 to 1,568.</p>

skew shape given to the coil ends in order that all the coils may be of one shape.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Fed-in Winding.</strong>&mdash;This name is given to a type of winding
possible with open or only partially closed slots, in which coils
previously formed are introduced, only a few inductors at a time
if necessary. They are inserted into the slots from the top, the
slot being provided with a lining of horn fibre or other suitable
material, which is finally closed over and secured in place by
means of a wedge, or by some other suitable means. An example
of a fed-in winding is shown in figs. 1,566 and 1,568.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1259" id="Page_1259">[Pg 1259]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Imbricated Winding.</strong>&mdash;This is a species of spiral coil winding
in which the end connections are built up one above the
other, either in a radial, or in a horizontal direction.</p>

<p>The winding is used especially on the armatures of turbine
alternators and dynamos.</p>

<p><strong>Spiral Winding.</strong>&mdash;This is a winding in which "spiral" coils,
as shown in fig. 1,569, are used. The spiral form of coil is very
extensively used for armature windings of alternators.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,569.</span>&mdash;Diagram showing a spiral coil. This type of coil is one in which each successive
turn lies entirely within the previous turn, starting with the outermost turn of the coil.
The successive turns of a spiral coil are thus not of the same size, and are not overlapping
as in a "lap" coil.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Mummified Winding.</strong>&mdash;The word <em>mummified</em> as applied
to a winding is used to express the treatment the coils of the
winding receive in the making; that is, when a winding, after
being covered with tape or other absorbent material, is saturated
in an insulating compound and baked until the whole is solidified,
it is said to be mummified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1260" id="Page_1260">[Pg 1260]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Shuttle Winding.</strong>&mdash;This type of winding consists of a single
coil having a large number of turns, wound in two slots spaced
180&deg; apart. It was originally used on Siemens' armature and is
now used on magnetos, as shown in figs. 1,459 to 1,461.</p>

Armature frames are of cast iron and ventilated. Interior transverse ribs strengthen
the frame and support the core laminations. The armature core is built up of annealed
and japanned punched laminations. Armature slots are open. Armature coils are form
wound, impregnated, and interchangeable; they are held in place with fiber wedges. Ventilating
spaces are provided at intervals in the armature core and also between all coil ends.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Creeping Winding.</strong>&mdash;Another species of winding, known as
a creeping winding is applicable to particular cases.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If three adjacent coils, each having a pitch of 120 electrical degrees,
be set side by side, they will occupy the same breadth as 4 poles, and,
by repetition, will serve for any machine having a multiple of 4 poles,
but cannot be used for machines with 6, 10 or 14 poles. Fig. 1,571
shows this example.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1261" id="Page_1261">[Pg 1261]</a></span></p>

subtending eight poles.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the same way 9
coils, each of 160 electrical
degrees, will
occupy the same angular
breadth as 8 poles.</p>

<p>Further, 9 coils of
200 electrical degrees
will occupy the same
angular breadth as 10 poles.</p>

<p>Now of these 9 coils,
any three contiguous
ones are nearly in
phase, if wound alternately
clockwise and
counter-clockwise.</p>

<p>For the 8 pole machine,
the phase
difference between adjacent
coils is 20 degrees.</p>

<p>For the 10 pole
machine, the phase
difference is also 20
degrees.</p>

<p>The cosine of 20 degrees
is .9397, consequently,
if 3 adjacent
coils be united in series,
their joint pressure will
be 2.897 multiplied by
that of the middle one
of the three.</p>

<p>The 9 coils may
therefore be joined up
in three groups of 3
adjacent coils, for the
three phases.</p>

<p><strong>Turbine Alternator Winding.</strong>&mdash;For the reason that steam
turbines run at so much higher speed than steam engines, the
construction of armatures and windings for alternators intended
to be direct connected to turbines must be quite different from
those driven by steam engines. Accordingly, in order that the
frequency be not too high, turbine driven alternators must have
very few poles&mdash;usually two or four, but rarely six.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,578.</span>&mdash;Stationary armature of
Westinghouse turbine alternator
with part of the winding in place.
Because of the small number of
coils in a turbine alternator as
compared with a slow speed machine
of the same kva. rating,
each coil carries a great amount
of power on large load, particularly
at times of short circuits or
grounds on the external circuit.
The "throw" of the coils is large,
leaving a considerable part of the
winding in the end turns unsupported
by the armature core. For
these reasons great stresses, which
are dangerous, if effective means
be not adopted to withstand them,
may exist between the coils. The
inductors are of such cross section
that they can be made rigid and
insulated satisfactorily. The end
turns are given a fan like form
as shown, affording ventilation
and effective bracing as shown in
fig. 1,577. Cord lashings are, except
in the smallest frames, used
only for holding in the small
spacing blocks between the coils.
They are not depended on to support
the coils. Malleable iron braces, hard maple blocks, and brass or steel bolts with brass
washers are used to withstand the mechanical stresses imposed on the armature coils by
external short circuits.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1265" id="Page_1265">[Pg 1265]</a></span></p>

<p>From the table, it is evident that a large number of poles is
not permissible, considering the high speed at which the turbine
must be run.</p>

large alternators. The field diameters are so small that the end turns of the winding
can be effectively bound into place, such binding being necessary with a radial slot
machine. The shaft and disc are a one piece forging of steel.</p></div>
</div>

<p><strong>Ques. How is the high voltage obtained with so few
poles?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. There must be either numerous inductors per slot
or numerous slots per pole.</p>

circumference of the cylinder are for the accommodation of the bolts that hold the bronze
end discs and stub shafts. In winding, the cylinder is mounted on a horizontal turntable

turn under pressure and strip insulation is wound in between. When completed the
turns are held rigidly in position with heavy brass wedges. An end disc made of bronze
holds the stub shaft and is bolted to each end of the steel center. When the leads are
attached to the collector rings the field is complete.</p></div>

<p><strong>Ques. What form of armature is generally used?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. A stationary armature.</p>

<p><strong>Ques. What difficulty is experienced with revolving
armatures?</strong></p>

<p>Ans. The centrifugal force being considerable on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1266" id="Page_1266">[Pg 1266]</a></span>
of the high speed, requires
specially strong
construction to resist
it, consequently closed
